Brazen was their\n                 skulduggery,\n                 waged in plain daylight. These rowdy toughs were not armed with\n                 whirling\n                 chains or brass knuckles or snug leather vests or sporty kerchiefs\n                 or\n                 fishnet ANYTHINGS, primarily I guess because they were not male\n                 strippers. They WERE however armed with the most daring accoutrement\n                 of\n                 all: generosity.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 They made a donation of $150 dollars\n                 American, a gift which came with a pretty firm stipulation. I was to\n                 use this money to\n                 <a href=\"http://iasos.com/artists/erial/celestial-soul-portraits/\">\n                 hire a man to create my celestial soul\n                 portrait</a>.\n                 In this way, I could have my soul properly beautified as well as\n                 immortalized. This would be accomplished by a guy named Erial Ali,\n                 who\n                 would surely have it on authority from the celestial deities\n                 themselves\n                 which way would be optimal to set my soul aflame with rainbows and\n                 random forehead lasers, and how many shitty space dolphins would be\n                 ideal to stick up in my grill.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But there was a catch, and no,\n                 that catch amazingly wasn't simply the 150 bucks it apparently\n                 requires\n                 to drop a few reduced-opacity rainbow gradations, mediocre masking\n                 effects and augmented saturation adjustments on a photo that your\n                 unemployed neighbor took of you in the back yard. The real catch was\n                 that Erial seems to demand to speak with you on the phone before he\n                 Photochops your bad high school portrait with resources mined from a\n                 Google Image Search of the Hubble Deep Field. I guess maybe to get\n                 to\n                 know your soul?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Either way, I knew this phone call was going\n                 to\n                 be intense. I actually got kind of psyched for it, for a while. I\n                 practiced a modified form of enthusiasm, the kind that was basically\n                 genuine enough to trick his soul-sweeping lasers that scour my aura\n                 for\n                 traces of irony. I was prepared to throw out a lot of buzz phrases\n                 in a\n                 really excited way, like I was really eager to see how he would\n                 \"blitz\n                 my chakras\". I was going to say \"blitz my chakras\" a lot. I'm\n                 serious\n                 about that. It was going to be my go-to line. Like, dude, just go\n                 apeshit on those chakras. I'm not paypalling you a Benjie and a half\n                 for\n                 a bunch of weaksauce chakras. I want a chakra you can hang your hat\n                 on,\n                 WHILE you fry an egg on it, and makes you HIGH just in the amount of\n                 time it takes you to go Google whatever the fuck a chakra\n                 IS.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But then I chickened out and just did the damn soul\n                 portrait myself.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/soulportrait_before_th.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/soulportrait_after.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 In\n                 the end, it wasn't really about not wanting to have a weird\n                 conversation with some strange dude in a robe. Yeah that was a\n                 factor.\n                 But let's get real here. I can Photoshop that guy under the table. I\n                 mean literally, I can literally make it appear as if he is squatting\n                 under a table in Photoshop. By doing the soul portrait myself, I am\n                 simply delivering a superior product to my devoted followers. I\n                 don't\n                 know what sort of rubbish Erial would have made. The fact of the\n                 matter\n                 is it would have been a costly and tedious exercise in\n                 disappointment.\n                 You're welcome for me not putting you through that,\n                 everybody.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The\n                 bonus is I get to keep the cash. Well, I just sort of decided this.\n                 I\n                 didn't really ask. But I have a longstanding tradition of\n                 misappropriating funds donated to me by people for\n                 <a href=\"blogspot/need-for-steed\">\n                 some really specific, peculiar\n                 purpose</a>.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I refer to such funds as \"Olive Garden\n                 Money\".\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I'm\n                 going to use all of this money to fund a series of trips to the\n                 Olive\n                 Garden, and I will document each visit carefully and report my\n                 findings\n                 to you. I will even\n                 <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100711005011/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=9005&amp;start=0&amp;view=viewpoll\">\n                 let readers decide on my menu selection via\n                 polling</a>.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 don't really like the Olive Garden that much, and my grave adherence\n                 to\n                 this franchise under these exceedingly precise circumstances doesn't\n                 make much sense. It's hard to explain. Maybe impossible.\n                 <a href=\"/blogspot/magicaljourney\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 I have a chronicled history with the\n                 restaurant</a>,\n                 or at least a history with TALKING about it, which is what makes\n                 this\n                 all so maddeningly stupid. But maddeningly stupidly WONDERFUL. And\n                 sometimes, just sometimes, truly wonderful things are just\n                 downright,\n                 ball-numbingly idiotic.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 While you were reading that\n                 paragraph, awful Italian music started playing in the\n                 background.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But\n                 the bottom line is, this Olive Garden money was first soul money, so\n                 really my soul is financing this enterprise. My soul will be\n                 subsidising\n                 gargantuan mouthfuls of cheesy shell shaped noodles or some sort of\n                 tangy-sauced shellfish entre I wouldn't order in a billion years if\n                 left\n                 to my own devices, but I might have to if my hand is forced. I'll\n                 probably leave a signed copy of my soul portrait along with the tip.\n                 My\n                 soul is making this happen. When you think about it, where would be\n                 without my soul? All of us?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The answer is we'd all be so far\n                 up shit creek people would start naming bad smells after us.\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/soul-money\" title=\"2010-07-06T02:57:00-07:00\">\n                    2:57\n                    AM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

I tend to stay pretty tight-lipped about it\n                 in\n                 the news section, since I'd honestly rather spend time making it\n                 than\n                 yapping about it all day. But hey I still realize that now and then\n                 I\n                 should strive to descend from above the stage, perched on my\n                 moon-shaped\n                 swing with my legs all a kickin' and swayin', and with ukelele\n                 cradled\n                 to my bosom, let you folks in on my FEELINGS.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But I just\n                 couldn't\n                 get up the gumption to sit down and COMPOSE with a capital C, and\n                 some\n                 other capitalized letters, some serious self-contained literary\n                 piece on\n                 the subject. So instead I just opened up a Q&amp;A session in the MSPA community\n                 and this is how it went.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Some of these answers\n                 are pretty long. I guess because I like to pretend what I do is\n                 complicated and nuanced.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Are\n                 user commands really affecting all that much? Other than the occasional\n                 \"Squawk like an imbecile and shit on your desk\" command.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 They are, but their influence is not always\n                 obvious.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 A\n                 command is actually a pretty superficial thing. It is only supposed\n                 to\n                 influence the present panel through a single atomic action. It\n                 shouldn't\n                 serve the function of aa command like \"Plot: Take a certain\n                 direction I\n                 have in mind.\" A command can't try to do too much, but they often\n                 do.\n                 With this sort of thing, there will always be tension between the\n                 author\n                 and the suggestors, whose main purpose is to leave their distinctive\n                 personal stamp on the story, and as a result, often resort to the\n                 outlandish, the overly elaborate, or the non sequitur. These are\n                 fine to\n                 embrace in small doses, but they are poison to a cohesive story if\n                 resorted to regularly.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Consequently, actions of a more\n                 straightforward variety become favored, and the appearance which\n                 follows\n                 is that the user voice has been diminished. This is compounded with\n                 a\n                 great abundance of commands. A simple example. The hero approaches\n                 three\n                 doors. Which will you choose? Obviously all three doors will be\n                 suggested with a large enough pool of suggestors, plus plenty of\n                 clever\n                 non sequitur \"option D\" commands. Knowing this, which door the hero\n                 goes\n                 through was always up to the author, whether he pre-planned it, or\n                 merely delayed the decision until the suggestions were made.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This\n                 principle is in play even with more complicated examples. A room\n                 full\n                 of objects. What will you do? For all intents, every possibility\n                 will be\n                 suggested. When the author knows he will have the field of ALL\n                 POSSIBILITY to choose from, it begins to mirror a more conventional\n                 writing process. That is what a writer does. He sits at his desk,\n                 combing through the field of all possibility in his mind, and\n                 arrives at\n                 the specific. This situation naturally leads to more pre-planning,\n                 and\n                 the greater appearance of marginalizing user input. But it is not a\n                 slight to the user. It is the nature of the creative process,\n                 rearing\n                 its head through this format.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Any remark like \"This story is\n                 not\n                 user-driven enough,\" I believe is code for \"This story is not\n                 haphazard\n                 enough.\" The wild and unusual commands are the ones that really make\n                 it\n                 feel like a gaggle of whimsical readers is in charge, imbuing the\n                 narrative with a sense of freedom, a feeling that the hero could do\n                 truly anything. The essence of freedom in this sense is the\n                 uncompromising subjugation of restraint. It is possible that this is\n                 also the exact opposite of what a good story requires! Regardless,\n                 the\n                 truth is almost all the commands are user suggestions, even the\n                 vanilla\n                 ones, which soften the voice of the user. Some are commands of a\n                 certain\n                 type I was looking for in advance, to push the action in a direction\n                 I\n                 had in mind. That is fairly unavoidable. To avoid it all the time\n                 would\n                 be unnatural, like a lobotomization of the creative process for the\n                 sake\n                 of maniacal adherence to a gimmick. But probably more often than\n                 not, I\n                 select commands on a whim, without any such narrative\n                 agendas.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I've\n                 kicked the tires on this format pretty aggressively. I've done the\n                 \"pick the first command no matter what\" thing, with its stream of\n                 consciousness results. I've kept the command selection more sedate\n                 and\n                 rational at times. And there are some stretches when I'm practically\n                 oblivious to the suggestion box, such as one or two week periods\n                 where\n                 my sole focus is on intensive animation chores, and the last thing\n                 on my\n                 mind is \"How can I get the readers more involved at the helm of this\n                 story??\" At times there gets to be a point where, with a story of\n                 this\n                 scope, the author can start to hear himself say, \"Oh great guys,\n                 just\n                 what I need. More funny ideas!\" The format, if nothing else, has a\n                 way\n                 of turning the author into a firehose of ideas, or at least it seems\n                 to\n                 for me. It sounds counter-intuitive, but eventually the best way to\n                 advance a story starts to be seeking strategies to curtail the\n                 endless\n                 stream of novelty, and slow the idea machine down a bit. I've done\n                 this\n                 at times by diminishing the influence of commands.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The\n                 introduction of the Wayward Vagabond as the command voice was an\n                 example of this. More on that topic later.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 How much do you have planned in advance right now?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 It's\n                 hard to quantify. It helps to understand what planning actually\n                 means in this context.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 When\n                 you do something like this, it seems like the attitude of many\n                 readers\n                 is that the action should be almost entirely extemporaneous, or at\n                 least\n                 be sold to feel that way. Otherwise, why bother implementing user\n                 input\n                 at all? When evidence of planning becomes exposed, it carries the\n                 appearance of cheating in a way. Like an improv comic, who largely\n                 relies on the appearance of being off the cuff for his act to feel\n                 authentic. If the audience catches on that some of the material was\n                 prepared in advance, or that the go-to jokes are applicable\n                 regardless\n                 of what suggestion is shouted from the crowd, it loses\n                 something.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But I'm not actually that concerned with this\n                 issue. It's not a problem. Just an observation.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The\n                 long and short is, some very big picture stuff is planned in\n                 advance,\n                 and has been since page 1. In particular, various SYSTEMS were\n                 planned.\n                 Systems related to how the game works, how items are manufactured,\n                 how\n                 the environment is manipulated, aspects of the virtual universe they\n                 enter, and the ultimate purpose of the game. These are systems, but\n                 systems alone do not a plot make.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 When it comes to plot\n                 elements,\n                 very little planning is done, and practically none at all before\n                 page\n                 1. A good example of the story taking an unanticipated turn is the\n                 post-apocalyptic elements, which I really had no idea I'd be getting\n                 into from the start. It felt like a necessary dynamic to add to the\n                 gaming system to help raise the stakes in the story. It was actually\n                 influenced by the various apocalyptic movie posters in John's room,\n                 and\n                 the discussions they had about them. Those were not planted in\n                 advance\n                 as foreshadowing, because there was nothing yet to foreshadow.\n                 Retroactive foreshadowing is a pretty common occurrence with\n                 projects\n                 like this. It often solidifies the illusion of planning. This was a\n                 case\n                 where some trivial nonsense I injected into the story turned out to\n                 be\n                 extremely relevant. Sometimes that happens with my own nonsense,\n                 sometimes it happens with reader-supplied nonsense.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But\n                 assuming\n                 there is some element of planning - and there is - the only issue\n                 remaining is how far in advance does story planning occur? That's\n                 why\n                 the subject of planning vs. extemporaneous story building is tricky.\n                 Plans don't exist... UNTIL SUDDENLY THEY DO! For example, there was\n                 a\n                 time when Jade (then known as \"GG\") made casual reference to having\n                 a\n                 pet, and a grandfather. These simple facts become a lock in the\n                 story,\n                 and it would be months until those details were elaborated upon. In\n                 the\n                 passing months, while I attend to other parts of the story, I have\n                 no\n                 choice but to dwell on those things she casually mentioned, and\n                 think\n                 about who they are, and how they fit into the bigger picture. This\n                 is\n                 certainly a form of planning, and the reader was witness to the\n                 plan's\n                 conception. And though technically, plot details which are sat on\n                 and\n                 incubated for months can no longer be considered extemporaneous, the\n                 ideas sure were extemporaneous when they were first\n                 mentioned!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This\n                 is exactly how most things end up being \"planned\". A concept is\n                 dropped\n                 on the reader, and then goes into hiding for a while. I think about\n                 it\n                 in the shadows. But even then, I deliberately keep the planned\n                 aspects a\n                 little vague and open-ended, so they can be modified to fit the\n                 details\n                 of the story when the time comes. This was especially evident when I\n                 started replaying certain Pesterchum conversations, from the other\n                 character's vantage in the past. At one point Dave was complaining\n                 about\n                 puppets. You could only picture what was going on at his end. In\n                 fact, I\n                 didn't even know, and I didn't really want to know. I let his\n                 narrative\n                 catch up to that point, then molded the events to match his side of\n                 the\n                 conversation. Again, the illusion of planning arises.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 That's\n                 what I do with every concept introduced. I try to keep it a little\n                 generalized and flexible, something I can return to later with more\n                 refinement, and mix with user input. That was the driving paradigm\n                 behind all the game systems. Everywhere you look with the game\n                 systems,\n                 you see inherent flexibility. The ability to combine items with\n                 other\n                 items. The ability to prototype a Kernelsprite with anything, twice.\n                 The\n                 ability to manipulate a house in almost any way.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The\n                 philosophy\n                 here is two-fold. The obvious side of it is, it allows readers a\n                 more\n                 built-in means of influencing the world we create here. But the less\n                 obvious motivation, and maybe the more important one, is that it\n                 helps\n                 spark the imagination of the reader. The story, ultimately, can only\n                 go\n                 down the path it goes down. But before it does, the reader can\n                 understand these game mechanics, and speculate on all the\n                 possibilities.\n                 What sort of objects would you combine if you were playing the game?\n                 What would you prototype with? What kind of villains would that\n                 create?\n                 There are millions of different versions of the game that could be\n                 played, a unique instance for each player. This is all theoretically\n                 supposed to be part of the fun.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Have you ever gotten ideas from the forum but not the suggestion box?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Yes,\n                 and in fact it's safe to say I get most ideas from the forum\n                 community\n                 at this point. At least more of the major story changing ideas come\n                 from\n                 there, while the suggestion box plays the role of driving the\n                 page-by-page action.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 When I integrated the suggestion box\n                 into a\n                 forum instead of a comments page, thus sparking a pretty vital\n                 community\n                 of story discussion, it changed a lot about how I interface with\n                 user\n                 input. Discussion and speculation about the story is much more\n                 engaging\n                 and nuanced than user commands can be, which are generally along the\n                 lines of \"Do this. It will be funny.\"\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 There have been a few\n                 times\n                 where I've read theories people are throwing around, and I'll just\n                 run\n                 with it in the story. Most often it will be a case where I was\n                 vaguely\n                 entertaining the same notion, but hadn't yet committed to it, and\n                 seeing\n                 it vocalized as speculation tips the scale in the idea's\n                 favor.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 One\n                 example I can think of is when people were trying to guess what\n                 Jade's\n                 grandfather's interests would be. People often try to make guesses\n                 about\n                 this sort of thing, because I tend to establish a lot of patterns,\n                 like\n                 each guardian having a kooky collection, each kid having a certain\n                 primary weapon and instrument, each kid potentially corresponding to\n                 a\n                 future desert-dweller, and so on. I then either adhere to the\n                 pattern,\n                 or disregard it, almost arbitrarily. This keeps readers on their\n                 toes.\n                 But in this case, people guessed quite a number of things, including\n                 knights, mummies, and game trophies. I ran with those three, plus a\n                 pretty strange wildcard interest on top of those to mix it\n                 up.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 It's\n                 hard to think of a lot of good examples of this though, possibly\n                 because all sources of inspiration have sort of blurred together. It\n                 gets hard to trace back to the origins of many of the\n                 ideas.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 When\n                 did the Wayward Vagabond come into play? Was it something vague like \n                 \"there's some dude in the future who accidentally stumbles his way into \n                 these events somehow\", or was he almost entirely just made up as things \n                 went along ala the segment we \"played\" as him? Did you only decide \n                 things about him playing part in a grander chess metaphor when you \n                 started working with Nanna's exposition? Did you always know that he \n                 ended up where Rose once was?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 That's a lot of questions! I'll group it all under what I'll dub THE WV\n                 UMBRELLA.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 WV\n                 was introduced, indirectly, at the beginning of Act 2 as another way\n                 to\n                 experiment with the format. Though the reader didn't know it at the\n                 time, WV was issuing the commands instead of the readers. All the\n                 readers knew was there was a funny voice controlling John, and that\n                 the\n                 suggestion box was locked. Or put in a more story-relevant way, the\n                 box\n                 had been \"blown up\", a consequence of the meteor impact. The image\n                 in\n                 the box was\n                 <a href=\"/storyfiles/hs2/crater/0607.gif\">\n                 replaced\n                 with a crater</a>, and in the weeks that followed that crater\n                 underwent gradual\n                 <a href=\"/storyfiles/hs2/crater/0614.gif\">\n                 geological</a> <a href=\"/storyfiles/hs2/crater/0621.gif\">changes</a>.\n                 Of course, only those who looked inside the suggestion box were\n                 privy\n                 to this aspect of the story, but that progression of images would\n                 resurface again at the end of Act 2.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The main purpose of the\n                 WV\n                 command experiment was to take a step back from that tension of the\n                 author-user dynamic for a while, and see how that went. The tension\n                 being primarily in the struggle to control the direction of the\n                 story.\n                 With a fictional character at the helm, you not only have a voice\n                 that\n                 can be more cooperative with advancing the plot (even though he\n                 didn't\n                 sound that cooperative), but also can be a more distinctive and\n                 unified\n                 voice of an actual character, with his own yet unknown agenda. It\n                 stayed\n                 that way for about a month I think. It was interesting for a while,\n                 but\n                 in the end I decided it wasn't the best way to drive the story in\n                 the\n                 long run, so I reverted to business as usual.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But the plan\n                 with\n                 WV, from the first command he issued, was that eventually he would\n                 become a playable character. I thought he would be playable (i.e.\n                 taking\n                 user commands) while the kids' actions remained buffered in that\n                 way.\n                 Of course it didn't quite pan out like that. They all became\n                 playable at\n                 once, each with his/her own suggestion box. But the difference with\n                 WV\n                 was that I made a concerted effort never to plan anything about his\n                 story arc. In fact, I've been pretty religious about keeping\n                 everything\n                 that happens in the post-apocalypse arcs as unplanned as possible. I\n                 don't think about it until I have to. So WV's story evolved very\n                 organically, entirely through cues from reader commands, much like\n                 the\n                 beginning of Problem Sleuth. But unlike Problem Sleuth, he existed\n                 in a\n                 world full of already well established story elements, so the\n                 whimsical\n                 material sort of collided with the more intricate storyline that had\n                 developed. So I could use his slapdash shenanigans to continue to\n                 expose\n                 layers of the mythology behind the greater story, like the chess\n                 metaphor and the kingdoms, all sort of indirectly through chalk\n                 drawings\n                 and cans of Tab and such. His arc was one of the more fun to execute\n                 for this reason.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 His involvement was pretty spur of the\n                 moment, a\n                 way to drastically mix things up. There was no grand architecture to\n                 it\n                 at all, other than \"he will issue commands, and then later, users\n                 will\n                 issue commands for him.\" But given that, I'm surprised by how his\n                 involvement made Act 2 feel like a fairly cohesive piece overall. It\n                 began with him finding the underground bunker in a wasteland. We\n                 knew\n                 nothing of him other than what a few cranky directives indicated\n                 about\n                 him. We watched him learn and develop, and later, in interacting\n                 with\n                 him directly, he supplied some reasons to like him and root for him.\n                 And\n                 finally at the end of the act, he blasts off in that bunker he found\n                 to\n                 open the act, and we see sequences that tie back to the end of Act\n                 1,\n                 such as the meteor collision with John's house, and the geological\n                 evolution of the crater that taunted anyone who tried to make a\n                 suggestion for a month.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Of course, these sequences raised\n                 more questions than they answered. After all, it was only Act 2.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Do you have any idea when you plan to wrap up Homestuck, or are you going to let it go until it reaches its natural conclusion?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Originally\n                 I thought it would run for a year, like PS did.

It has taken a lot longer to get the\n                 story\n                 revved up than I thought. This is largely due to experimenting with\n                 and\n                 taking the time to master different media, like Flash. But also due\n                 to\n                 the more general and universally applicable principal: EVERYTHING\n                 WILL\n                 TAKE LONGER THAN YOU THINK IT WILL, ALWAYS. I never planned to run\n                 PS\n                 for a year from the start. It just worked out that way. If I had, it\n                 probably would have taken two years.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 What I'm thinking now\n                 is,\n                 04/13/10 will still be a key date. The story will build to something\n                 critical on that date. But then it will keep going for a while\n                 longer,\n                 to allow it to wrap up more naturally. Whether this is for another\n                 year,\n                 or less, I can't say. But I'd rather it not be more.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Do you know how Homestuck's going to end?

The execution of content\n                 is\n                 quite different from what it was even one year ago (though still\n                 stylistically similar).

But that was before this self-imposed gauntlet\n                 of\n                 working with Flash and figuring out more efficient animation\n                 strategies.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But\n                 watching the site evolve to support that type of content has me\n                 thinking it will just keep evolving. The broadest purpose of the\n                 site is\n                 to serve as a sort of accelerator for my abilities as a creator.

The\n                 inspiration\n                 centered around a simple scene I had in my head, and not much else.\n                 I\n                 pictured a kid playing a game in his room, while another player\n                 manipulated his room the way you edit an environment in The Sims. I\n                 pictured the kid being able to manipulate the other kid's\n                 environment\n                 too, but it wasn't long before I latched on to the potential\n                 conflict\n                 present in one kid strictly being at the mercy of the other. Over\n                 time I\n                 came up with other game mechanics to complement this, and add some\n                 degree of purpose. In this time I also developed this image of a\n                 story\n                 template that combined an RPG like Earthbound with games like The\n                 Sims\n                 and Spore. Even now that still seems like a pretty good way to\n                 describe\n                 Homestuck, though the story didn't unfold the way I pictured at all.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/scraps2/char_sketches.jpg\">\n                 I\n                 also designed all four characters</a> shortly before I started HS. I didn't know much about these\n                 characters\n                 at the time, other than some really vague personality profiles.\n                 Users\n                 named them as they were introduced.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Did you have names to refer to the characters before they were named by the users, and what were these names if there were any?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 No,\n                 but they did always have their Pesterchum handles before they were\n                 named.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Was 'Homestuck' the only title you had in mind for Homestuck, or were there other titles you considered but decided not to use?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 The\n                 only other candidate I considered was \"Sburb\", which was a sort of\n                 deliberately ugly word reminiscent of the name of a Sim game. You\n                 could\n                 either liken it to Sim-burb, or to Spore, another crude 5-letter\n                 word\n                 beginning with S. But for that reason, that it's kind of crude and\n                 really awkward to say, I thought it was best left as just the name\n                 of\n                 the game in the game.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Besides, Homestuck better follows the\n                 templates of the previous adventure titles, like\n                 Jailbreak.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 If I remember correctly, the designs we have for the kids were your second attempt.

Basically,\n                 picture the kids as they are now, but with squarer heads.\n                 <a href=\"/mspa/000604\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 Like\n                 the thugs from PS</a>.

I gave up, restarted on 4/13, with less frequent\n                 interspersals\n                 of Flash. Through the arbitrarily designated significance of the\n                 starting date, it went from a story about 4 10 year olds to one\n                 about 4\n                 13 year olds.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 To answer: not at all. The age never mattered.\n                 There's a tradition in cartooning of ignoring the age of a child\n                 when\n                 considering his/her demeanor and degree of sophistication. See:\n                 Calvin\n                 and Hobbes. Cartoon kids will act according to their age when it\n                 feels\n                 relevant. Other times, they won't.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Maybe the biggest\n                 difference\n                 in the hop in age is the very slightly added plausibility to\n                 speculation\n                 on any romantic angle between them. This is very important for fans\n                 who\n                 aspire to, and are busy even now, shipslashing these characters into\n                 oblivion.

I'm going to need another 16 pawns, so I'll stick 16\n                 cans of Tab in the other vault.\" That's a plan committed to in\n                 advance\n                 by days, or a week, or whatever it was.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But then knowing\n                 that,\n                 it's a little deceptive what was planned that way, and what wasn't.\n                 You\n                 might think I stuck the oil and chalk in the room to manufacture\n                 those\n                 outcomes, the chess game and the wall drawings. Not true at all. The\n                 oil, chalk, amber and uranium were stuck in the room strictly as\n                 parallels to the four types of known grist. The fact that he used\n                 them\n                 in those ways was a convenient bonus, and could possibly be viewed\n                 as a\n                 happy coincidence. Honestly when I drew the firefly in the amber, it\n                 never occurred to me that it would be released and become a cute\n                 ally.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 You\n                 could look at these stories, HS and PS mostly, as huge strings of\n                 these\n                 happy coincidences. When I recognize the potential for those kinds\n                 of\n                 connectivity, I try to make as much hay out of them as possible.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 The\n                 kernelsprites seem like a great potential way to let input radically \n                 impact the course of the story. Do you have all of the prototypings \n                 planned ahead already, or do you intend to leave at least some of them \n                 up to reader influence?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 There have been significant\n                 allusions in the story that certain prototyping outcomes are\n                 inevitable.\n                 Will this pan out? We'll see. Nothing is set in stone.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But\n                 this was always an area where I'd intended readers to have\n                 significant influence, and I'm sure it still will be.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Were the Guardians already planned (with designs?) along with the kids, or were they designed later?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 All\n                 the guardians were drawn a day or two before they first\n                 appeared.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 And for the really big things (lets say the flash), what's the averageish storyboarding time for it?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Never\n                 more than 10 minutes. Spending too much time on storyboarding feels\n                 like wasting time I could be spending on the \"real\" work.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Time\n                 spent on actual execution of a Flash animation on average is a day\n                 (or a\n                 night, more typically). The one requiring the most time was the end\n                 of\n                 Act 2 animation (obviously, I'm sure), which took something like 3\n                 or 4\n                 days. It's hard to say for sure, because I was making the WV\n                 countdown\n                 animation that preceded simultaneously.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 A cruel irony for me\n                 personally is that the longest hiatuses the site has to endure are\n                 periods of time over which I am working the hardest.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 OH WELL.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 How much better at Flash would you say you are now than when you started?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Good\n                 enough to use it. More than can be said when I started. Speed is the\n                 primary dividend of experience for me. It may seem like I'm getting\n                 better with the quality of the animation at the same time. But if\n                 this\n                 is the case I think this mostly results from increased speed. When I\n                 learn how to save time, I always tend to apply those time-savings to\n                 producing things that are increasingly elaborate. The latter half of\n                 Problem Sleuth documented this phenomenon with animated\n                 GIFs.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Do you plan to use the same kind of sound effects shown in the first strife page of John for future flash updates?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 think I'm done with the SFX. They're sort of a pain to create and\n                 add,\n                 and I'm a bit neutral on how they enhance the experience. Later on I\n                 might completely change my mind though. Who knows.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 What is your favorite color?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 am equally suspicious of all of them, though we begrudgingly\n                 collaborate through an uneasy truce.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 Did you learn from personal experience, or did someone else warn you about stairs bro!!!!\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 fell down some stairs once as a child and have been warning people\n                 ever since.

Some of his conversations have been\n                 lifted\n                 word for word from my own chat logs, modified somewhat for\n                 context.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 So, I know about the EarthBound parallels, kind of, but what about Mother 3?\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 haven't played it.

I sort of wanted\n                 to\n                 take the opportunity to let this stuff tell a little story, and add\n                 some\n                 depth and detail to the Homestuck universe.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 There are two\n                 character shirts available,\n                 <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-ghost-white\">\n                 John's</a> and\n                 <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-squiddle-white\">\n                 Rose's</a>.

John's shirt, which of\n                 course\n                 appears to be Slimer from Ghostbusters, is actually a depiction of\n                 an\n                 Asian knock-off of Slimer called the\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/mspa-ghost-print.png\">\n                 GREEN SLIME GHOST</a>.\n                 Rose's shirt was once a depiction of a character from a fake cute\n                 cartoon show which I totally made up called \"Squiddles!\". She then\n                 went\n                 about defacing this shirt to make it look mean! The shirt itself\n                 actually appears to be defaced, with ink missing around the eyes and\n                 mouth area (but it's a pretty subtle effect, because the ink color\n                 is\n                 very close to the shirt color).\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The cool thing about\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/mspa-squiddle-print.png\">\n                 Rose's print</a> is you can get either the faux-Lovecraftian defaced version, or the\n                 undefaced version (so you can deface it yourself!) Just make sure\n                 you\n                 select the option you want underneath: \"LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!\" if\n                 you\n                 want the defaced version, or \"DON'T LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!\" if you\n                 want\n                 it unmolested!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 So there you have it.

I have done this a couple\n                 <a href=\"blogspot/fancy-santas-are-stupid-imposters\">times</a> <a href=\"blogspot/need-for-steed\">already</a>,\n                 but this is only the tip of the iceberg. It's sort of selfish of me\n                 to\n                 horde those articles, so I have resolved to slay the dragon in my\n                 bosom\n                 known as Avarice and release this treasure unto you all.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 In\n                 this\n                 case, that treasure was plundered from several adventures I embarked\n                 upon through the world of dumb internet banner and popup\n                 ads.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The first was\n                 <a href=\"/blogspot/offeryoucantrefuse\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 An Offer You Can't Refuse</a>, first transcribed\n                 in the heady times of 2006.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The second, authored more than a\n                 year later, was\n                 <a href=\"/blogspot/magicaljourney\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 Come With Me on a Magical Journey Through the\n                 Internet!</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 There's\n                 plenty of other stuff I will release later, in lieu of writing\n                 actual\n                 new content (GOD FORBID). But some of it is pretty exciting. Among\n                 the\n                 essays are excerpts in which I voice a\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 strong desire\n                 </span>\n                 to accost host\n                 of Food Network's\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Unwrapped\n                 </span>\n                 ,\n                 Marc Summers, with a bright red ping pong paddle.

My plan was to complete the whole story\n                 in Flash, adding interactivity, music, and stuff like that. I\n                 completed 8 pages.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This\n                 turned out to be way too much work. To put this in perspective,\n                 doing\n                 these 8 relatively simple pages was MORE DIFFICULT AND TIME\n                 CONSUMING\n                 THAN ALL THE\n                 <a href=\"/mspa/001710\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 SEPULCHRITUDE ANIMATIONS</a> COMBINED. I am not\n                 joking about that!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 don't know if this says more about my inexperience with Flash, or my\n                 proficiency with Photoshop (in which all PS work was done). Probably\n                 both. I don't mind dealing with Actionscript, really. It was the\n                 whole\n                 environment I had trouble with. It felt very unnatural to draw in,\n                 and\n                 difficult to manage everything spread across multiple time lines and\n                 movie clips. Even doing simple things was like pulling\n                 teeth.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 So in order to prevent the story from grinding to a\n                 halt down the road, I just switched back to Photoshop and\n                 <a href=\"/mspa/6\" target=\"_blank\">\n                 started\n                 over</a>.\n                 I kept the Flash version online, and recast it as the \"Homestuck\n                 BETA\",\n                 which now appears to have been \"released\" three days prior to the\n                 current version. You could even call this a happy coincidence that\n                 appears to have been planned, since it echoes an aspect of the\n                 story, in\n                 which the beta for a game was released three days prior to his\n                 birthday.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But I guess MSPA tends to be full of these sorts of\n                 coincidences which make you wonder what was planned and what wasn't.\n                 But\n                 here I am telling you it wasn't planned! I should really work on\n                 being\n                 more mysterious.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 (You will also note, the age of the\n                 character\n                 jumped from 10 to 13 in this three day span. This is, for mysterious\n                 reasons, because the \"magic number\" for this story is now 4/13\n                 rather\n                 than 4/10.)\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Perhaps ironically, the Homestuck beta, which was\n                 never supposed to be a beta, genuinely did serve as a beta! I had a\n                 chance to test out some things there, and when I realized it wasn't\n                 working, I pulled the plug. But I got to establish the Flash page\n                 infrastructure on the site, so now I can use Flash pages whenever I\n                 want.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 And I intend to! Sparingly. Mostly for when I want to\n                 include musical elements, which was really my biggest reason for\n                 switching to Flash in the first place.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The bottom line is,\n                 the\n                 adjustment I made now feels right. Overall, I like the look better.\n                 And\n                 the production is virtually effortless, a process streamlined over\n                 hundreds of pages of Problem Sleuth. This will allow me to update\n                 with\n                 crazy amounts of pages as usual, which I think you will agree is a\n                 very\n                 important thing. Maybe the most important thing!\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/flash-is-hard\" title=\"2009-04-15T16:06:00-07:00\">\n                    4:06\n                    PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

I almost find it distasteful to participate in the same\n                 discipline in which thrives such a loud and broad display of clumsy,\n                 floundering suck. I guess this phenomenon has its roots in the\n                 coronation of the Superbowl as the great custodian of funny commercials.\n                 These commercials are popularly alleged to be as much of a draw to the\n                 high ratings event as the game itself, and I guess this just got\n                 corporations thinking; why not make every day the Superbowl? And they\n                 did. Now every day is like a fresh, highly competitive Superbowl of\n                 unfunny bullshit.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I could go on about \"funny\" commercials and why\n                 I hate them forever, but who has the energy for that? (Especially after\n                 we've all eaten ourselves into a wheelchair from the customary April\n                 Fools feast.) Occasionally there are some genuinely funny commercials. I\n                 just don't care. All the unfunny \"funny\" ones ruin the funny \"funny\"\n                 ones completely. I'm tired of waiting for the shoe to drop in the\n                 30-second bullshit vignette on Glade scented candles. I'm tired of\n                 \"funny\" moments being punctuated by awkward pauses of silence (while we\n                 all laugh, I guess. And then meditate on Werther's Originals.) I'm tired\n                 of people getting hit in the groin with a can of Green Giant corn, or\n                 backed over by a Hertz rental car, and hearing them shout \"I'm ok!\" in\n                 the fading moments. I don't want to laugh, and the attempt to inflict\n                 this reaction on me is causing me pain. There's a good chance I am\n                 watching the show I'm watching for this very purpose, to be made to\n                 laugh. The creators of this show are ostensibly good at causing this\n                 reaction.\n                 <span style=\"font-style:italic;\">\n                 You aren't\n                 </span>\n                 , Holiday\n                 Inn.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 It's not that I want commercials to be funnier, up to the\n                 standards of the few that are funny. It's that I want them all to stop\n                 being funny. Do you remember a time when not every commercial was trying\n                 to be a damned Farrelly brothers movie? I do. They just said, \"look, we\n                 sort of have this product...\" and played some catchy music. They were\n                 benign. Ignorable. Corporations have forgotten their role in the social\n                 order. I don't want them to be cool, or to be my friend, or to make me\n                 laugh. Corporations should be stodgy, blunt, and humorless, and if it's\n                 not to much to fucking ask, mildly nefarious.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Now we can look\n                 forward to them latching on to pranks. Oh boy! And as with \"funny\"\n                 commercials, they will seize them as competitive advantages (re: adhere\n                 to them unwaiveringly as competitive upkeep). Thus will begin the kind\n                 of obnoxious one-upsmanship we see with funny commercials, with\n                 companies trying to be ever edgier, ever more surprising in their\n                 April's gotchas. Coke isn't going to take it lying down when Pepsi\n                 reveals in April, 2012 that 30% of all Pepsi cans the previous year\n                 contained moderate to major amounts of fetal tissue floating in the\n                 liquid [PSYCHE]. Let us begin a great arms race. Not one of munitions\n                 and warhead stockpiles, but of whoopee cushions and chattering\n                 teeth.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 -----------------------------\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 END DIATRIBE\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Anyway,\n                 I wonder which big company will play pranks on us this year and bag a\n                 few chuckles from the dude sitting behind the desk at CNN during a 30\n                 second spot? Last year it was Google uniting with Virgin and pretending\n                 to colonize Mars. Hehehehehe!

I recognized him and proceeded\n                 to orbit about his radiant, molten core of affability, but I did not\n                 introduce myself. Later in the evening I mumbled my name, and he\n                 recognized it, and offered a hug to celebrate the recognition. It was\n                 not because he was inebriated; the beverage in his hand was a root beer\n                 you see. Neither was it on account of chilliness. He's just a hella nice\n                 guy!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I also met Zach Weiner, which was another high point. He\n                 does\n                 <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/\">\n                 SMBC</a>,\n                 which is a comic that has the uncanny ability to be EXTREMELY FUNNY on\n                 EVERY SINGLE OCCASION IT UPDATES, which is JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. Zach\n                 was also all hells of cool and drew me a picture of a llama with a brain\n                 in a jar for a head. I'll keep it folded in my breast pocket for the\n                 rest of my life, until one day it takes a bullet for me. The very bullet\n                 which passes clean through it and into my heart, rendering me not alive\n                 anymore.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 There was also a gentleman named John Keogh who does a\n                 comic called\n                 <a href=\"http://www.lucid-tv.com/\">\n                 Lucid\n                 TV</a>, which I had not read before.

You should check it out too.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This encounter was\n                 precipitated because he said hello and told me he liked my work. Not\n                 MSPA in this case, but a comic I used to do a while ago called\n                 Humanimals. I'm always impressed when someone has heard of Humanimals\n                 before, and I am downright flabbergasted when people tell me they\n                 actually like it.\n                 <a href=\"/archive/tso/blurbs/00085-h.gif\">\n                 Here's\n                 a sample</a> if you care to trespass into...\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I'll shut my\n                 flowery trap this once.

The Topatoco HQ is quite an impressive compound and\n                 looks like a wonderful place to do business.

I had no idea at the time that\n                 it was physically located about 15 minutes from where I lived, in\n                 Cambridge MA.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Naturally I had to go celebrate its existence as\n                 well as my physical proximity to it by standing in front of it.

Fichter's work is apparently\n                 everywhere, including two striking works of genius less than a block\n                 from my residence.

Galvez's shit is just fucking pandemonium. The composition is\n                 an airy, rambling hodgepodge of disagreeable-looking horseshit. These\n                 grotesque harbingers of diversity at once frenzy to stoke my nightmares,\n                 or whatever you call the type of dream you'd like to shake by the collar\n                 and backhand repeatedly.

The decision to use this *particular* photo of\n                 her, and make her a dominating 9-foot fixture in the mural: DUBIOUS.\n                 She's probably been dead for years. Her legacy: BOUNDLESS, SOUL-PUMICING\n                 TERROR.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 6) Is this some sort of black trucker vampire? Is this\n                 child in danger? I might suspect so, but she looks so sinister herself\n                 that she's likely his netherworldly superior.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 7) I don't...

It reminds us that despite appearances, deep down we are all\n                 alike: harrowingly one-dimensional.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 9) Other cultures can at\n                 times be quite flamboyant! This man has passionate feelings in his\n                 bosom, and they must take the shape of rhythm come hell or high water.\n                 He'd sooner cut out his heart than cease wailing on his bongos. If\n                 someone snuck up behind him and pulled his hat down over his head, can\n                 you really say you'd have the maturity to not laugh at his expense? The\n                 answer is no.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 10) Fanciful headwear on a black woman:\n                 check.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 11) Is this a culture? What sort of culture is it?\n                 Caucasians who wear togas while playing jazz? Are we saying that\n                 embarrassingly drunk people comprise a culture unto themselves? Memo to\n                 this guy: you are fired from Diversity.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 12) Disturbing\n                 encroachment on chubbykid moneyshot: check.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 13) And these people?\n                 Perhaps this man is a poor caricature of Ray Romano? I am going to guess\n                 that this family is vaguely Mediterranean due to the bit of chest hair\n                 poking out from the man's shirt to the right. The hairy dude also seems\n                 to be rather oily. Is it really TOO much to ask that our murals\n                 celebrating racial diversity not be subtly racist too? Additionally --\n                 the woman appears to be trying her best to not cause me physical harm\n                 with her facial expression. She is not succeeding.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Also to the\n                 upper right, it looks like camera glare has obscured the Indian family\n                 riding their fucking magic carpet, thus sparing you a joke about them.\n                 THIS TIME.\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/pot-of-gold-at-end-of-cultural-rainbow\" title=\"2009-03-14T15:46:00-07:00\">\n                    3:46 PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

A couple hundred thousand\n                 tuned in on the last.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The beginning was humble in ways that go\n                 beyond a simple reader count. Humble might not even be the right word.\n                 The word's blade might need to be dulled further -- from something used\n                 to slice butter, to something used to ladle paste into the mouth of an\n                 infant.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I was wondering what sort of story to make, so I drew a\n                 detective on a blank canvas. Then I thought he should be in a room, of\n                 course. Probably a detective's office, because that's where detectives\n                 usually are. He needed a phone and a gun. Clearly those two items would\n                 alone suffice, I thought. The wall over there looked a little blank so I\n                 drew a safe. A window for ambience. A door for exit, which may or may\n                 not have been locked; I wasn't sure yet.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 What I was also\n                 oblivious to was the two other detectives who would show up later, and\n                 to their adjacent offices. I was oblivious to the world of imagination,\n                 and the desk-made fort that would be its gateway. I didn't know the\n                 window lead there either, and I didn't know you could only get to that\n                 place I didn't know about if it was plugged in. I didn't know about the\n                 candy in his pocket, the dames in their dollhouse, the kingpin in his\n                 ship, or the weasel in his palace.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Those I's would be dotted by\n                 your suggestions, and the T's would be crossed by my reaction to them.\n                 It was a storytelling game of cat and mouse, and you presumably just\n                 finished reading the aftermath of our year-long, Tom and Jerry-style\n                 rampage through the house.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 And if at the beginning you told me I\n                 would have a group of characters fight a single giant monster every day\n                 for almost six months, I would have told you... well, I would have told\n                 you that sounds awesome! But then I probably wouldn't have done it.\n                 Because I would have known I was going to do it. And what fun would that\n                 have been?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 It's hard to believe it's done, I'm sure mostly for me\n                 personally. If you do the math, you'll note I produced an average of\n                 more than 5 images per day, every single day for that year-long stretch.\n                 In retrospect, it was a matter of routine inseparable from day to day\n                 existence. I didn't notice the effort, and I didn't notice the year. It\n                 wasn't a labor. It was just what I did.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But I guess it's more\n                 than just a shift in habitual momentum. There's a note of melancholy.\n                 These detectives won't be up to their antics anymore (unless I make\n                 deliberate exceptions to their retirement, of course). It seems strange\n                 to me that these characters have become so well defined in my mind, even\n                 though they've never uttered a single word. It was never supposed to be\n                 that way. It was just supposed to be about a cruddy-looking dude in his\n                 office.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But that said, I'm pretty excited to get working on\n                 something new. And maybe, if you're not all that busy, we could take the\n                 first step of this amazing new journey together.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Thanks for\n                 reading!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 - Andrew.\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/end-of-problem-sleuth\" title=\"2009-03-10T20:40:00-07:00\">\n                    8:40\n                    PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

But it looks like he eventually and quite understandably\n                 muttered \"fuck this\" and stomped off to plunder the kitchen for some\n                 delicious Slimer-themed\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/ecto_cooler.mp4\">\n                 Ecto\n                 Cooler</a> Hi-C.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 You'll note some striking similarities between\n                 my and Jeff's work, aside from breadth of ambition.\n                 (Amphibition?)\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 They both dwelt on swampy planets. Though mine was\n                 supposed to be Earth, since my story followed a Superman template. I\n                 figured he might as well since he shared a prefix with that hero. Jeff's\n                 looks like it fits into more of a Star Wars mold, which would make\n                 \"Amphibia\" somewhat akin to Yoda's swampy planet I guess.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Also\n                 note that while Jeff's planet was plagued by a \"terrorist group called\n                 MEGA\", my story was published by MEGA comics. This is obviously a word\n                 one dare not leave uncapitalized. Also both these frogs had really cool\n                 underground lairs.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But I'm afraid that's where the similarities\n                 end.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 11 year-old Jeff's handwriting is actually better than mine\n                 is today, let alone the grisly marks which I pawned off as letters at\n                 age 11. You'll also note Jeff could actually string together a pretty\n                 decent sentence. \"<a href=\"http://wigu.com/superfrog/003-sm.jpg\">But,\n                 Amphibia was not without its evil forces…</a>\" Note the fairly\n                 sophisticated use of the double negative to take a little something off\n                 the sentence for rhetorical purposes. He could have taken the easy route\n                 and said \"Amphibia had so many evil forces!\" Or, \"Amphibia had all hella\n                 evil forces up ins, yo!\" if he wanted to produce a tone of jocular\n                 irony. (Although I doubt that sort of irony had been invented yet in\n                 1986.) The point is, he wasn't using language as a blunt instrument to\n                 say what he wanted to say.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Whereas I took that blunt instrument,\n                 used it to murder a family of four, and hid the bodies in my garage.\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart2.jpg\">\n                 You will\n                 observe this sample.\n                 </a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 It's actually hard for me to believe an\n                 11 year-old did this. To me it doesn't look very far beyond the reach of\n                 a 6 year-old. Where does one even begin dissecting this?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Ok, the\n                 Dr. Claw-style boss wants his henchman with an upsettingly phallic hat\n                 to go down to the \"science plant\". Where they do science. He wants him\n                 to steal some science. Fair enough. Then he instructs him to take a\n                 \"disgise\", and we shortly receive a humorous payoff. His disguise is\n                 simply a jacket. Ha ha, right?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Maybe. Except that I explicitly\n                 remember that I did not intend for this to be a joke. I was serious.\n                 That was his serious disguise.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Then at gunpoint, or maybe tube of\n                 Ben-Gaypoint, he commands the aardvark fellow to surrender the main\n                 project. Like, the main science thing they do. He wants him to hand over\n                 the big science thing. But it turns out he \"already launched it\". He\n                 launched all the science they were working on into space, and he is\n                 sorry about it. Maybe if the snake with the dick hat got there a little\n                 earlier, all that science would still be there.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Then later on in\n                 the comic when I got tired of all this storytelling bullshit, I went and\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart3.jpg\">\n                 drew\n                 a\n                 map</a>. This was my first hack at a comic, and I don't think I\n                 actually even liked comics. All I really wanted to do was design the\n                 next Super Mario Bros. game and mail it to some Japanese developers. I\n                 actually tried to do this several times, and I just assumed whoever\n                 looked at it would be blown away by my ideas while making little hushed\n                 noises of polite awe in that distinctly Japanese way.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 When I was\n                 11 my teachers thought I was retarded. This isn't some sort of joke to\n                 make you laugh. This is actually true. For a while thereafter I resented\n                 the accusation. But looking back on this work I'm starting to think they\n                 might have been technically right. Whatever the case, I don't know why I\n                 ever had the notion that I was artistically inclined before age\n                 11.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But in looking through this archive of relics, it's pretty\n                 clear my artistic development took a major leap in the following year.\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart4.jpg\">\n                 I did\n                 this\n                 drawing</a> when I was 12. Ok, so it's obviously inspired very\n                 heavily by Rob Liefeld's work in the early 90s. Still, looking back on\n                 it I think it's probably better than anything\n                 <a href=\"http://progressiveboink.com/archive/robliefeld.html\">\n                 Liefeld\n                 ever did</a>. I even came up with a kickass signature brand for that\n                 year, \"DREW92\". WHOA, COOL DUDE!!!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Then from there it appears my\n                 artwork enjoyed\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart5.jpg\">\n                 pretty</a>\n                 |\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart6.jpg\">\n                 brisk</a>\n                 |\n                 <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/oldart7.jpg\">\n                 strides</a>\n                 through the rest of high school. Actually that first image there seems\n                 somewhat reminiscent of a Problem Sleuth villain, even though I drew it\n                 about 15 years ago.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 My and Jeff's stroll down Super Frog lane is\n                 reminding me the more things change, the more they stay the same. Don't\n                 believe me?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/before_after1.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/before_after2.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                    Mob\n                    boss villains separated by two decades.\n                    <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/before_after3.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                    You're\n                    eventually supposed to grow out of shit like this, right?\n                 </div>\n<br/>\n                 I don't know why I didn't scan the rest of Super Frog. The samples\n                 above are from an archive consisting of photos I took about five years\n                 ago. I'm not sure what my thinking was at the time.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I'll see if I\n                 can dig up the original book and scan all of it. If I do, I'll post it.\n                 But I'll be trailing behind Jeff's documentation of his old comic, which\n                 I suppose is only fitting. He was always ahead of the curve on this\n                 Superfrog/Super[space]Frog business.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Oh, also\n                 <a href=\"http://blake-reitz.livejournal.com/107167.html\">\n                 another\n                 guy cropped up</a> who did a Superfrog (Super-Frog, with a dash!) when\n                 he was a youngster.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Look, if you are 11 and you are a boy, here's\n                 what's up. You're going to be drawing a COMIC. That comic will be about\n                 a FROG. That frog is also gonna be SUPER. This is what your DNA will\n                 tell you to do, and if you don't do it there's probably something wrong\n                 with you. This is what SCIENCE says will happen, and this can be\n                 verified, assuming some dumbass doesn't go ahead and launch that science\n                 into space first.\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/if-you-drew-comic-called-super-frog-at\" title=\"2009-02-21T13:28:00-08:00\">\n                    1:28 PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

They're great, you guys!

[I think I\n                 probably mentioned something about opera glasses, or goggles here, which\n                 he retrieved from his glovebox. I'm not sure why I would suggest he keep\n                 such a thing in his glovebox. I think my motivation was probably to use\n                 language to cast him as a bit of a lithe-fingered fop.

He took a bite and chewed, frowning at his dinner. He sprinkled some pepper on top, and took another bite. The sandwich appeared to satisfy him now, and he dispatched it quickly, drinking the water all in one go at the end. Impressive. He then reached for his empty glass, turning it upside down and using it like a microphone. I couldn't hear clearly, but it sounded like he was reciting \"Baby Got Back\", sitting there at the dinner table. I felt like he was putting on a show for my benefit. I got suspicious - did he know he was being watched? But then some water slide down the glass onto his lap and he jumped up, brushing his slacks down and running out of the room, cursing. It was that little detail that made the whole evening worthwhile.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 said something kind of complicated in response to this… wait, oops, hang\n                 on…\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Ryan. I'm going to say something kind of complicated in\n                 response to this. The basic gist of it will be that while you are\n                 distracted by my outrageous domestic broadcast and its embarrassing void\n                 of self-awareness, I took the opportunity to deploy a servant through my\n                 cellar door and into the yard and had him shove a whole can of cookie\n                 dough into your car's tailpipe.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 CHECK AND MATE, prank\n                 buddy.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Alright I didn't say that last part, but in just\n                 transcribing it now, oh man. It was just so sweet how I did that to his\n                 car.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Ryan didn't really see it that way though.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 February 6th, 2009: Okay, so I guess Andrew has, like, a butler? Who he pays to stuff food into my car's exhaust pipe? And that's fine, that's cool. We all need jobs. But when I drive home and my car stalls out a few minutes in and it's because the tail pipe is blocked with chocolate-chip cookie dough, it's not that awesome. Andrew's house is at the end of a deserted lane surrounded by a bunch of fields, and now I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 So I walk back to Andrew's place - takes about 20 minutes. I ring the doorbell. No answer. I knock on the door. All the lights are on; I know he's home. I go round back and I stand in the dark of his back yard and I can see him there in his living room. His soggy slacks are spread out on the couch. His underpants are tasteful. He's rapping again. It sounds like - yes, it's Rapper's Delight. Andrew's really belting it: \"Have you ever went over a friend's house to eat / And the food just aint no good? / I mean the macaroni's soggy, the peas are mushed / and the chicken tastes like wood.\"\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 I've never realized how much of that song is about food.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 At\n                 this point I don't actually need to make up an approximate ridiculous\n                 reply, because I can submit word for word the ACTUAL RIDICULOUS REPLY\n                 which I typed.

I also usually supply the, uh,\n                 <a href=\"https://mrcheeze.github.io/andrewhussie/finearts1.htm\">\n<br/>external resources</a>. Jan supplies a lot of input\n                 to the \"scripting\" process too.

Oakland Raiders linebacker Bill Romanowski fending off a wild, flaming black steed, in a mystical snowcapped mountain setting. I don’t know if it’s the concept alone, which itself is obviously mind-blowing. Maybe it’s also the curious, vaguely-humanoid musculature of the horse. It has a man’s bicep and triceps, and some very suspiciously man-like back muscles. Or maybe it’s the flaming mane, which on closer inspection, doesn’t resemble flame so much as synthetic orange puppet hair. This steed is either from hell, or has recently escaped Fraggle Rock, and is ready to tear the entire NFL a new asshole. But he didn’t count on bumping into Bill Romo (understandably, since he was bucking around the middle of the damned Himalayas).\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 wrote that several years ago, and before I catch myself extolling the\n                 grandeur of the painterly genius of “T” again, I’ll just get to the\n                 point. A couple years ago around the same time of year, a little before\n                 Christmas, I wrote “T” an email offering to purchase the painting. In\n                 addition to gushing about his work with strategically vapid and\n                 obsequious prose, I offered him $50 for it. This offer was more than\n                 fair, I thought. He however declined, saying he simply could not accept\n                 any less than $400 for it.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Ok, so obviously I thought this guy\n                 was out of his fucking mind, turning down good money of any quantity for\n                 this ugly piece of shit. But that was probably just the anger of\n                 rejection talking. I would get over it.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Recently, I offered to\n                 buy the painting again, hoping he might have forgotten about his\n                 hard-line stance and come to terms with the unsellability of his putrid\n                 work (oops, there I go again with the bitterness. I have good reason\n                 again though.) I was prepared to offer another $50, maybe go a little\n                 higher if necessary. It’s turning into a kind of Christmas tradition.\n                 This is how all of the finest holiday traditions begin, I think. Through\n                 hostile adherence to something pointless and mildly\n                 excruciating.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This is how the latest interaction went down.\n                 Here’s the pitch I opened with:\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 ———–\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Hello,\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 I am writing you in regard to this beautiful painting\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 listed on your website.

The tone is right, and I think I\n                 tailored my demeanor to seem just convincingly stupid enough to\n                 genuinely like this retarded painting (which I do!). Notice how I\n                 downplayed his vicious prior obstinacy by referring to the paintings as\n                 “unavailable if I recall”. Master stroke. Also I didn’t come out firing\n                 with a dollar figure, mainly because I didn’t want to scare him off\n                 right away. I needed to ease him into the fact that I am still only\n                 willing to part with $50 for this abomination.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Anyway, this was\n                 his reply.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 ———–\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Hey Andrew,\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Thanks for checking back. I do have a price on the painting it is $425. A few people have e-mailed me about buying it for less, but I would rather just hang on to it. I like the piece a lot and haven’t painted anything since it. It was to be the first in a series of sports fantasy paintings, but I have gotten side tracked with my job and other family things so I haven’t started painting again. I will get back to it soon. So, if you want it for the $425 it is yours, if not, I will keep it on my wall.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Thank you\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 T\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 ———–\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 I grope for language\n                 to describe my reaction. Nay, a single word.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 LIVIDITY.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 $425??\n                 So it seems he actually\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 raised\n                 </span>\n                 the\n                 price over the years. Oh, and PARDON my skepticism at the implication\n                 that he has received other offers over the years for his idiotic shit.\n                 He is probably only vaguely recollecting the ONE time it happened. From\n                 ME.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Naturally, I swallowed my indignation like the bitch I am. I\n                 just need that painting, and obviously it’s going to take more fancy\n                 footwork to pry it from his grubby, miserly hands. I responded, and this\n                 was my first sentence.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 Wow, it is very cool that it is still for sale!

Whatever obscure pocket of\n                 personal acumen this is, I seem to possess it in spades. I probably\n                 could have been one of those spies who entrenches himself in Russian\n                 territory, uncovering intelligence on nuclear sites. Except instead of\n                 nukes, I would be disarming the Russian aristocracy of all their shitty\n                 paintings of horses, and vanishing with them into the\n                 night.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 $425 is a lot of money for me. But I think your work\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 is good and you deserve to be compensated well for it.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 If\n                 his heart wasn’t made of stone, it would melt at this line. I am playing\n                 up to his megalomaniacal belief that his work actually has value,\n                 combined with voicing a sad state of affairs for myself, like I am a\n                 charity case. For all he knows, I’m like Tiny Tim with a crutch, holding\n                 up my tin bowl, and instead of asking for gruel, saying, “Could I please\n                 ‘ave a paintin’ sir, preferably an NFL-star-battling-horse themed one,\n                 sir?” These sentiments would tickle any artist starved for positive\n                 feedback for his ghastly work, assuming he wasn’t totally deranged.\n                 Unfortunately, his heart is made of stone, and he is deranged.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 went on in that reply, trying to strike up a deal, but he didn’t\n                 respond. I was prepared to dish out more toadying remarks, too, like\n                 seriously encouraging him to take up painting again, and saying I would\n                 love to see him continue his series of sports fantasy paintings. This\n                 has the added bonus of being true. How about Terrel Owens putting a\n                 unicorn in a headlock while forging through an enchanted jungle? Or star\n                 kicker Adam Vinatieri kicking an ogre in the groin near a dark wizard’s\n                 castle? Or quarterback Tom Brady kissing a male elf atop a bubbling\n                 volcano? This series would be fucking dynamite, and I’d love to own the\n                 whole set (as long as I didn’t have to sell my kidneys for it).\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Anyway,\n                 if I want this painting, obviously the only thing I can do is pay the\n                 full price for it. And I think you will agree, it would be ridiculous\n                 for me to spend that much of my own money on it.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 That’s where YOU\n                 come in!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 So\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 pony\n                 </span>\n                 up with\n                 the donations guys, and soon you will enjoy the vicarious delights of\n                 owning a completely unique work of art, through me!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 If you\n                 donate, I will do something for you. I’m not really sure what yet. It\n                 depends on the size of the donation. If it’s only like $5 or $10, I\n                 might just write you a detailed thank you note. Maybe I will email you a\n                 custom sketch or a comic too, we’ll see. If you make a bigger donation,\n                 like $50, you can feel free to be more demanding with my time, like tell\n                 me to draw you a comic and mail it to you. I don’t know, but I’ll make\n                 it worth your while. Come on guys, let’s work on this together!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Of\n                 course the biggest reward is the giving itself, and knowing you are\n                 contributing to a cause much more worthwhile than something lame like\n                 upgrading my computer. YAWN!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The donation thermometer is ready to\n                 skyrocket!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fundraiser1.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Caveats\n                 and provisos: In the event that there are some donations, but the target\n                 is not reached, I reserve the right to spend the donations on whatever I\n                 want. Like dinners at the Olive Garden. I also reserve this right should\n                 the target be reached, but I no longer really feel like buying the\n                 painting.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;font-size:85%;\">\n                 ------\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 So as you can see from the above “progress bar” graphic, the donation figure steadily climbed to $145. This was very promising, but it was still a long way off the mark, and I was beginning to suspect I would fall short. I was already contemplating the succession of succulent Olive Garden feasts I would be using that money to finance. The kaleidoscope of savory Mediterranean flavors had begun to work its powers of affordable, family-dining hypnosis on me.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But not so fast.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Early in January of the following year, this is what happened.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 ------\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-size:180%;\">\n                 Posted 01/07/2008\n                 <br/>\n                 \"WE FUCKING DID IT!\"\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 Ladies\n                 and gentlemen…\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fundraiser2.gif\">\n<span style=\"font-size:130%;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 VICTORY.\n                 </span>\n</span>\n</a>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 TLDR -\n                 Yesterday, two incredible guys, both named Paul, independently of each\n                 other donated the full remainder needed to buy the painting. Yeah, you\n                 may want to read the story. It’s fucking epic.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 How was this feat\n                 possible? Needless to say, the magnificent achievement’s brick and\n                 mortar was the charitable will and good grace of you, the readers. Alas,\n                 noble though your efforts were, they were not enough. Standing on your\n                 shoulders, I only reached halfway up the wall, a far cry from being\n                 allowed to glimpse the pleasure gardens of painterly depictions of\n                 unbridled equine savagery waged against professional sports legends.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 It’s\n                 at this point in the story which I smile and tap my pipe on the heel of\n                 my shoe. My gaze becomes abstracted, my eyes shimmer. I am no longer\n                 with you.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I am crumpled under the barstools of an unaccountable\n                 dive somewhere. I marinate in puddles of liquids to which I myself\n                 contributed not moments ago. I mumble incoherently with my lips around\n                 something—I think, and pray, it is a bottle. Slurred words wander from\n                 the drowsy orifice, and occasionally stumble from a runny nostril.\n                 “Horse”, was it? “Romanowski”, did I say? If the other disinterested\n                 patrons of the bar strained to listen, they might have made out the\n                 phrase “epic mountaintop struggle” as well.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I thrash. My\n                 delirious convulsions become more pronounced. Feverish visions pester\n                 me, like an overzealous carnival employee lurking, poised to frighten in\n                 a shoddy haunted house. My breathing is heavy. “No… horse…” I say. “I\n                 can’t… linebacker…” I wheeze. At once I sit upright, and shout, “I will\n                 never own that painting of a horse attacking a champion of the\n                 gridiron!!!”\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 There was a voice. A rich, amber-throated sort of\n                 vocal honey.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 “Yes you will.”\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 My eyes\n                 find a pair of shoes. Cream-colored, polished like the ivory bust of an\n                 African prince, presented as a gift to European royalty. Draped over\n                 them, cuffs belonging to pants, also cream-colored and well pressed. I\n                 look up. And up. This man had no end! His elegant form broadened as it\n                 ascended, and was stopped, nay,\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 commanded to halt\n                 </span>\n                 by a pair of shoulders so sturdy, a banquet for a devout Catholic family\n                 of fifteen could be served on each, and the settings would not jostle an\n                 inch while a pious,\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 severe\n                 </span>\n                 grace\n                 was conducted by the patriarch. Hanging on these shoulders was a coat of\n                 immaculate cut, and a slightly different cream color. Other colors of\n                 cream accented his tie, shirt, and kerchief, and above all those was a\n                 bronze, manly face. His smile was wide and serene, his eyes winter blue,\n                 deep with kindness. He wore a cream-colored hat.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The room hushed.\n                 Somewhere a utensil fell onto a piece of glass or ceramic. Everyone\n                 knew.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 It was Paul Elsewho.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 “But… but sir. I can’t buy it.\n                 I haven’t the monetary discretion for the painting.” It was the\n                 sniveling blither indigenous to the tongue of the truly\n                 pathetic.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 “You do now,” the man said, clicking a ball point pen,\n                 which now busied itself above a checkbook. “You can and you will buy\n                 that painting of a steed grappling with an Oakland-area\n                 athlete.”\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The words resonated from his amber throat. I knew any\n                 words from it would be true. He handed me the check for $155 United\n                 States dollars.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Even though I know in my heart the assurance of\n                 this man stretches further than that of the U.S. Treasury for the merit\n                 of the currency he gives me, my craven mouth cannot help but persist in\n                 its loathsome habits of doubt. “But sir… what if it’s\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 still\n                 </span>\n                 not enough?”\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 That’s\n                 when the door exploded off its hinges, as if punched inward by the\n                 searing daylight. The light was then blocked by another imposing form,\n                 its silhouette boasting the contours of an exquisite physique. “\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 That’s where I come in,\n                 </span>\n                 ” boomed\n                 the rugged, gravelly voice.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I clutched the garb of Paul E. and\n                 hid behind his confident frame. I quivered like a reprehensible bit of\n                 cowardly gelatin. Through the tears, I saw who it was. Everyone did. It\n                 was the legendary Paul W.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 He tossed his scarf over one shoulder.\n                 The tables in the room lifted an inch off the ground with each\n                 astonishing footstep. The bartender hid. Paul dropped a sack full of\n                 valuables, which made a noise like a gypsy’s cart smashing into a brick\n                 wall. Printed on the bag was “$155”. As I opened the bag, a gleam of\n                 golden yellow illuminated my wonder-stricken face.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The mighty\n                 Paul W. caressed his stubble thoughtfully while giving me a stern look.\n                 The corner of his mouth turned upward, ever so slightly, and he winked.\n                 “Yeah, that oughta do you just fine,” he said. A man in a bowler cap\n                 sitting in a dingy corner must have rubbed him the wrong way at that\n                 moment. Paul W. turned to the man and, with a ferocity in his eyes\n                 typically recalled only by dead lion tamers, said, “What the fuck are\n                 you looking at?” The man’s head exploded.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Yes, the other Paul was\n                 right. It\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 did\n                 </span>\n                 oughta do me. It\n                 did oughta do me\n                 <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">\n                 just fine\n                 </span>\n                 .\n                 These two noble, charitable, magnificent men entered my life and changed\n                 everything. They asked for nothing in return. Indeed, what does one give\n                 the man who has everything, and everything to give? These two radiant\n                 titans of masculine virtue, they are perfect. They are gracious\n                 perfection itself. I feel emboldened as I am flanked by my two Pauls, my\n                 saviors of brawn, my dapper hulks of sapient mettle. I can do anything\n                 with my Pauls. My arms interlock with theirs, and together we spin\n                 pinwheels into the night. Spinning, spinning, laughing, and\n                 spinning.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I speak to you as a man who has had his faith in\n                 humanity not merely restored, not merely gutted, refitted with high-end\n                 parts and refurbished, but as a man who has had humanity itself, in the\n                 form of two exquisite Pauls, invest its faith in me.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I speak to\n                 you as a man who has just purchased a painting of an orange-haired pony\n                 flicking its hooves at a strapping pigskin warrior.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I speak to\n                 you—\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\n                 VICTORIOUS.\n                 </span>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"font-style: italic;font-size:85%;\">\n                 ------\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I promptly took the money and ran like the black-sinewed, scarlet-maned wind.

It is a spirited, flaming-maned buck against the petulant voice\n                 which tells us our dreams can’t come true, and we are just wasting our\n                 time.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Dreams do come true. Your wildest wishes can happen. Magic\n                 is real. Fairytales are sobering nonfiction, and your bravest fancies\n                 are a rock-fucking-solid lock. Hold fast to your dreams and soon you\n                 will hold them over your head like the beating, dripping heart of the\n                 enemy commander.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 When one commits his entire being to an idea or\n                 an outcome, never relenting or wavering, he cannot be stopped. It is not\n                 a matter of stating firmly, “One day, I will have that painting.” It is\n                 a matter of stating, and believing, “That painting is already mine. The\n                 momentary separation between myself and the painting is incidental to\n                 the reality, and of no consequence.” When one compresses all his drive\n                 and concentration onto the head of a pin for one goal, it can no longer\n                 be considered a goal. It is a conclusion manifest in the furling\n                 parchments of reality itself.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 So I urge you to celebrate this\n                 victory with me. The road was long and rocky, the potholes numerous. But\n                 in retrospect, any perceived suspense was merely destiny’s sleight of\n                 hand!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/horsevictory_photochop1.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/horsevictory_photochop2.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/horsevictory_photochop3.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/horsevictory_photochop4.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/horsevictory_photochop5.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n                 AND\n                 SO ON\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/need-for-steed\" title=\"2009-01-07T13:19:00-08:00\">\n                    1:19\n                    PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

It is probably the only thing worth salvaging from that blog and in this season of sharing I feel it is important to share it with you.\n                 </span>\n                 )\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 hate Fancy-Santas. Unlike the archetypical Santa, the cliché with the\n                 bright red suit, white beard, and unassuming accessories like black\n                 boots and mittens, the Fancy-Santa tries to be more than the cliché. He\n                 drapes himself in ruffled velvets, expensive European leathers, peculiar\n                 hats, and often can be found carrying around armloads of weird things,\n                 like a wreath, or a swan, or a fucking bush.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But what’s worse is\n                 his attitude. The Fancy-Santa acts like he’s too good to be a normal\n                 Santa. While a normal Santa is jolly and friendly, the Fancy-Santa is\n                 aloof and acts like a complete prick. He likes to think he’s mysterious,\n                 tiptoeing through the woods, occasionally pausing to cast an abstract\n                 gaze into the northern sky. What mortal could dare to even fathom the\n                 grand majesties behind his ice-blue eyes and gaudy attire? What mortal\n                 could afford one of his bullshit dolls or figurines?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 You’ve\n                 probably seen a Fancy-Santa slowly rotating on a QVC broadcast for about\n                 $900, while a spokeswoman gingerly strokes his velvet robes. She uses\n                 words like “beautiful” and “exquisite” and “precious”. To her, the\n                 Fancy-Santa resembles everything good and decent left in her life, a\n                 life looted of joy by a succession of boorish ex-husbands. There is\n                 nothing boorish about a Fancy-Santa though. He is thoughtful, dignified,\n                 elegant—the perfect gentleman. And the perfect catch for a lonely\n                 middle-aged woman, if she could just find him in the fucking woods\n                 first. (protip: set a bear trap)\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Still don’t know what I’m\n                 talking about? You’re lucky, then. But I’m afraid your good fortune runs\n                 out here.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This is a Fancy-Santa.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta1.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Just\n                 look at that asshole. Who the fuck does he think he is? What is he so\n                 happy about?\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Listen, you imposter. You are not Kris Kringle. Put\n                 down the wreath, take off your silly robes, and go home.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 They are\n                 always decked out in an absurd plethora of ridiculous shit. He’s got a\n                 small crystal tree. You know, in case of an emergency. And some kind of\n                 weird lacey doily hanging from it. Also, a list for authenticity’s sake,\n                 because—ha ha!—he’s got to confirm which children are naughty or nice.\n                 As if he’s going to be giving children jack shit.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 If you ever run\n                 into a Fancy-Santa like this, the only proper recourse is to splash your\n                 eggnog in his face and pull down his pants.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Next. Get a load of\n                 this horse’s ass.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta2.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 There’s\n                 always a vague implication that Fancy-Santas are a kind of rugged\n                 proprietor of the wilderness. A great mystical outdoorsman, oozing\n                 communion with nature. He is a noble champion of the woods and all its\n                 critters.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Bullshit!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 He’s a glorified bum. Just because he\n                 lives in the woods doesn’t mean he owns them. And just because animals\n                 are stupid enough to sidle up to him doesn’t mean he won’t eat them and\n                 then use their pelts to craft another luxurious hooded robe. I imagine\n                 happening upon a Fancy-Santa skulking around in the woods is sort of\n                 like seeing Bigfoot. Except Bigfoot probably has the decency to at least\n                 dig a hole before he takes a shit on the ground.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This next one is\n                 a better example than the previous two, and I hate him all the more,\n                 because he takes himself more seriously.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta3.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 It’s\n                 hard work being such a monumental bullshit artist like a Fancy-Santa. It\n                 helps to look grave and stern, as if you are burdened by crushing\n                 mountains of hidden wisdom. Secretly, the only wisdom he guards is an\n                 array of handy pointers on how to get fleas out of a beard.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 I\n                 guess the unspoken hook to a Fancy-Santa is that they’re supposed to be\n                 magic. Like a fucking wizard. They really look like wizards, but with a\n                 Santa twist. I think the Fancy-Santa thing is really just a way for\n                 wizard freaks to get their jollies (yes, that was a Santa pun). But they\n                 can do so through the safety of mainstream Christmas orthodoxy.\n                 Similarly, the same middle-aged women who like wizards possibly like\n                 them because they remind them of Santa, the great paternal emblem, and\n                 perhaps hence, the “perfect man”. This perhaps further is the disturbing\n                 central pivot point for some weird fetish or visceral attraction\n                 programmed into the female mind set to erupt in middle age. The\n                 wizard/Santa allure is deep-rooted stuff, and expresses itself in many\n                 ways. I wonder if it explains in part the popularity of Harry Potter.\n                 Dumbledore was sort of like a Fancy-Santa. I wonder if J.K. Rowling\n                 collects Fancy-Santas. Of course, Dumbledore was proven to be gay, which\n                 on further reflection may be a critical part of the mythos. It makes\n                 these ideal mystical men unavailable, furthering the complex of\n                 unattainability. Come to think of it, now I’m sure all Fancy-Santas must\n                 be gay too. They are FANCY, after all. The rouge cheeks, the playful\n                 smirks. It’s all adding up. They’re a bunch of nomadic fags whisking\n                 through the snow.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 But in reality, they aren’t even really all\n                 that magic. Because they’re stupid frauds. I mean, what can they really\n                 do that’s all that great? Maybe give you a sly wink, and when you turn\n                 around again, he’s gone. BIG FUCKING DEAL! He’s a self-absorbed jackass\n                 who would never use whatever lame powers he has to help anyone. He’s\n                 certainly not delivering presents. The real Santa doesn’t mess around.\n                 He’s got a whole army of slave labor devoted to making toys, and\n                 actually has the means to deliver them. A Fancy-Santa barely bothers\n                 with the pretense. He might get around to giving kids presents if all\n                 the children on the earth happened to live in the fucking woods with\n                 him, maybe in a two mile radius. But they don’t, they live in houses\n                 like normal people. Whenever a Fancy-Santa carries around toys, it is\n                 just for show. If you see him walking around with a teddy bear, I can\n                 guarantee you that in the near future, rather than give it to a\n                 youngster, he will burn it for warmth.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Then there are ones like\n                 this, which are doubly infuriating. This dude thinks he’s Gandalf the\n                 White. Jesus Christ, he’s so fucking pure, I bet every time he bends\n                 over, a flock of white doves flaps frantically out of his\n                 ass.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta4.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 It’s\n                 passed off like he’s the Lord of Winter or some bullshit. If you ever\n                 see an idiot like this traipsing around, the proper thing to do is\n                 approach him from behind and push him into a pile of snow and then run\n                 away.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This one is riding a fucking bear. Go to hell,\n                 numbnuts!\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta5.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Look\n                 at the absurd hat on this one. And what exactly does he think he’s going\n                 to do with that sled full of toys? Who’s he trying to kid? Even he has\n                 to feel too much shame in his reprehensible appearance to parade that\n                 sled around in public. Anyway, I doubt he could push that thing more\n                 than a mile through the woods before suffering from cardiac\n                 arrest.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta6.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Then,\n                 as if standard Fancy-Santa fare weren’t dreadful enough, there are these\n                 themed ones. This one is sort of hobo-themed. This wayward wintry\n                 bindlestiff gazes vacantly into the clouds as if wondering where it all\n                 went wrong.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 The answer is of course the moment he decided to\n                 become a Fancy-Santa.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta7.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Surf’s\n                 up!!! There are few pleasures that compare to the experience of wringing\n                 sea water out of a puffy white beard.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 This Fancy-Santa seriously\n                 needs to just go fuck off.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta8.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 Even\n                 the Orient is getting in on the act! This Fancy-Santa is absolutely\n                 terrifying. I can’t tell whether he embodies the spirit of Christmas, or\n                 the malice of a dark Asian emperor. I’ve never seen a Santa, or any\n                 holiday figure, who I suspect would beat the shit out of me with one\n                 hand while he used the other to sip calmly from a bowl of\n                 soup.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/blogspot/fancysanta9.jpg\"/>\n<br/>\n                 That\n                 is all I have to say about Fancy-Santas for now. But there is a lot more\n                 to say on the subject, and when I uncover more of these vile and\n                 stomach-turning truths about these frauds you can be sure that I will\n                 post all the dirt here.\n                 <br/>\n<br/>\n                 Maybe come Christmas morning the true\n                 Saint Nicholas will have left something to this effect beneath your\n                 tree.\n                 <div style=\"clear: both;\">\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post-footer\">\n<div class=\"post-footer-line post-footer-line-1\">\n<span class=\"post-author vcard\">\n                    Posted by\n                    <span class=\"fn\">\n<span>\n                    Andrew Hussie\n                    </span>\n</span>\n</span>\n<span class=\"post-timestamp\">\n                    at\n                    <a class=\"timestamp-link\" href=\"/blogspot/fancy-santas-are-stupid-imposters\" title=\"2008-12-23T12:01:00-08:00\">\n                    12:01 PM\n                    </a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n"

Instant syntax upgrade. It's hard to believe this is even the same person talking!<br/>\n<br/>\nInconsistency can be one of great calling cards of utter trash. Glorious inconsistency, artful inconsistency even, I think is something to behold. It's like a window into a defective mind. These are principles I employ in SBaHJ. They interest me for some reason. Will this sentence end with a period? No, looks like it won't. But this one will. Why was that particular word misspelled? Why not just misspell every word? That would make no statement. It would invite no speculation into a uniquely defective thought process.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nFeb 24, 2010 - Mar 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

The fans were only ever in control in a limited way, and everything takes shape at my discretion. people just get really carried away with the whole \"reader driven\" idea and form these weird fantasies about how it works, and then take umbrage when my decisions are in violation of this fantasy protocol!<br/>\n<br/>\nreally the only thing i don't like about the format is it seems to lend itself to these misunderstandings.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nMar 7, 2010 - Mar 9, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

I don't think it was worth the effort you and your team put in. I love it, but you could've saved time and made it better.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\non some level i agree, but to scrap initiatives like that entirely goes against the grain of the experimental nature of this thing. (also in this case my \"team\" is really just me and gankro. there wasn't THAT much more effort involved than usual, save his coding efforts done mostly in tandem with the art.)<br/>\n<br/>\ndramatically speaking, it would have been more powerful to arrange a hard wired animation set to cool music, and dictate exactly what the reader is supposed to see and learn about the story. but the downsides are you sacrifice the curveball element, and fail to push the envelope on the medium. i prefer keeping these upsides, even if just in small doses.<br/>\n<br/>\ni found it kind of interesting to see the variety of reactions to that page, specifically that there appears to be a class of people who are grumpy about the concept, when faced with having to do something themselves to drive the story. which is a somewhat understandable reaction. if you go to a movie and all you want to do is tune out to what's on the screen and let the director do all the driving, you'd probably be perplexed or irritated if a controller popped out of the seat in front of you half way through and you had to control the characters for a while. but that's not quite what you're signing up for here. anything goes, and the only reason i don't do stuff like that more often is due to the labor involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut when i see that sort of reaction to it, it makes me think i should be doing it more. people get comfortable with the status quo very easily, even when that status quo itself isn't all that old (i've only been including these heavy duty flash animations in mspa for less than a year). meandering outside this comfort zone gets people agitated, and the more people get agitated the more i'm tempted to think i'm on the right track, or at least further exploration is warranted. sometimes a good idea has to be really rammed down people's throats for them to understand it's a good idea, because you'll always have to surmount their curmudgeonly resistance to innovation, and as always, the preposterous love affair the masses seem to have with mediocrity.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nApr 5, 2010 - Apr 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

        "html": "<div class=\"question-container\"><h2><a href=\"/formspring/andrewhussie448980558\">\nWere the trolls an element you had planned out from the beginning, or did you only come up with them later on in the story? They seem so integral at this point, despite their late introduction.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nthey were absolutely not even remotely planned from the beginning or anywhere close for that matter.<br/>\n<br/>\nwait let me copy something i wrote from somewhere else that might be informative.<br/>\n<br/>\nit's about the DNA letters, the pesterchum name abbreviations, and how that led to the trolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DNA connection began well before I ever even thought of the trolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nI named EB, TT, TG, in that order. I noticed an unfolding pattern with the latter two, and then named GG to solidify this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\nI assumed EB was just a special case for whatever reason, much like he is in other ways. For instance, the other three all have close birthdays in December, while his is in April. I figured very early on that he would have an alt account to complete the pattern, but hadn't developed the plot device to explain the alt until the trolls surfaced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe DNA connection with GT, TT, TG, GG I also noticed early on, and in fact largely precipitated the existence of the trolls, and was the sole reason for there being 12 of them. (12 remaining DNA letter combos, and some people theorized there would be 12 based on this before it was clear how many there were.) Additionally, the fact that there were 12 was what prompted the zodiac connection.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt may also be interesting to note that for GT, TG, TT, and GG, the like-letters are girls, and differing letters are boys, which correspond to chromosomes XY (male), and XX (female). Trolls do not follow this pattern because, first, there are only AA and CC left which would mean only 2 girls in the group ( :C ) and second, they aren't human, so their chromosomes probably work differently. For now, all we know is the girls begin with G, but the logic probably needs to be more elaborate than this if there are any more girls in the group.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is further rationale for John's defection from the pattern, from GT to EB, which possibly will never be explained in the story. What caused him to defect was the trolls, a group ostensibly lead by CG, whose name obviously implies cancerous disruption within a genetic system, or a DNA code. His cancerous influence causes a defect in the full string of genetic characters, from GT TT TG GG | CG GC GA AG AC CA TA AT TC CT AA CC to EB TT TG GG | CG GC GA AG AC CA TA AT TC CT AA CC. This is the nature of cancer, to corrupt genetic data. There may be additional relevance to the fact that John defected to ectoBiologist, the name of a pseudo-science sounding similar to carcinoGeneticist. In fact, I believe this will prove to be relevant later on.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nApr 7, 2010 - May 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

(from my perspective. from your perspective, these things still seem like bombshells i guess.)<br/>\n<br/>\nboth of those concepts mentioned were thus planned as such more than a month in advance i think, and i just hung on to the ideas until they were ready to spring.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut then there are little adjustments that happen in the execution which i don't plan, and just pull out spontaneously. often this involves scaling back an idea because it's a bit too complicated to depict in the hot frenzy of grinding out a flash animation. a lot of times i think i have more time in an animation to squeeze more events in, but in reality, it's really easy to chew up the minutes of a song with a few simple cinematic events, and you turn around and you're out of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nthat phenomenon leads to a lot of the density present in the animations. segments where seconds are going by and things are flying by so fast you barely notice all the detail coming together to tell the story, so you have to replay it a few times to get it.<br/>\n<br/>\nbut that's fine, it's part of the format being forged here. in a video game cut scene, you don't really always have the luxury or inclination to go back and replay it. here you do, and replays are actually a fairly critical part of digesting everything.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nApr 15, 2010 - May 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

They utilize this uncensored medium as an incubator of sorts for their abilities as humorists before exploding onto the standup circuit. While this will is universal, being a natural humorist is far from it. Luckily, I have a roadmap that will guide you towards the appearance of being funny on the Internet, if strictly adhered to.<br/>\n<br/>\nMention Ninjas.<br/>\n<br/>\n“A blur of black in a dim room. As the emperor ponders his koans, he cracks an eyelid. But it’s too late. Who else could make off with ancient scrolls and the lion’s share of a kind emperor’s spine before the shutter has yet swung closed from entry? If your answer was ‘not a ninja’, you’re fucking retarded.”<br/>\n<br/>\nNinjas are evidently hilarious. Particularly if alluded to in a manner that might be construed as tongue-in-cheek. But not completely. You don’t want to come off like you’re making fun of ninjas, because it is common knowledge that they are awesome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are unlearned in the vicissitudes of cyberspace, you may find this confusing. I will try to explain. The first thing to realize: ninjas are awesome. There is nothing not awesome about them. They are practically the archetypical embodiment of awesomeness. So what exactly is so funny about them? Actually (and this is what may be hard to understand), nothing at all. When a ninja is invoked in any context, the response promotes the illusion that something humorous was said. But what has actually occurred is a mutual celebration of ninjas’ all-around awesomeness, kind of like an “implied high five”.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut wait, there’s more. You don’t want to get too wrapped up in how awesome ninjas are. That would be comedic seppuku. This will breed an attitude of reverence, and you begin to take them too seriously. Taking things seriously is nerdish, and very unfunny, especially on the Internet. You will become the target of ridicule, rather than targeter. This is why you must take a step back, and strike that intuitive balance between reverence for, and an outright mockery of ninjas. The joke becomes the fact that they are awesome, and they become MORE awesome because they are the joke. Place them in curious juxtapositions, mix them with references to pop culture. You’ll get the hang of it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd one final thought. Once you have digested all of this, and then mastered it, realize this profound scrap: the joke is actually the joke. Meditate on THAT.<br/>\n<br/>\nMention Pirates:<br/>\n<br/>\nPirates are also hilarious, and mentioning them will make you hilarious as well. This is for a similar set of reasons that make ninjas are funny. They are awesome. But awesome for different reasons. True, both classes share themes of danger, deadliness, and being generally badass. But while ninjas convey stealth, precision, and cunning, pirates evoke a sense of adventure, bravado, and foolhardy swagger. Their passion for buried riches is legendary, and they are not too proud to sing and dance either, provided a steady flow of rum. Mentioning pirates will conjure visions of all these things, and your friends will be enamored of your ruggedly adventurous sensibilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut as is the case with ninjas, your deployment of pirate references must also be tongue-in-cheek. You don’t want to come off as actually being into pirates seriously. That would be idiotic. Again, it’s like a verbal high five in celebration of pirates and what they represent. Consider a literal high five for a moment, between a couple of guys. It’s not about the momentary slapping of skin. It’s a symbolic gesture celebrating good times. If it were actually about the touching, the feeling of the other male’s skin on yours, and that’s what you liked about the high five, your mate would quickly become uncomfortable as you prolonged the gesture, caressing his palm. He would think you were gay. This brings us to the next point…<br/>\n<br/>\nCall Things “Gay”.<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing associated with homosexuality on the Internet, particularly being called “gay”, is to be avoided. On the other hand, calling people and things “gay” yourself is a good way to help you in your quest to be funny. It lets people know the following:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) You aren’t too politically correct to humorously equate homosexuality with something negative. This is not to say you dislike gays or the practice of being gay. You just know how to stay loose and have fun, you know?<br/>\n<br/>\n2) You clearly have opinions on things, particularly dislikes. Hating things, or more importantly, appearing to hate things, is a really excellent way to create the illusion that you have interesting thoughts, and a complex set of criteria for evaluating things for quality. This will intrigue people, who may secretly fear that your outlook on which things are gay might be more sophisticated than their own. Who knows, you may get some converts to your (largely fictional) set of values.<br/>\n<br/>\nCall Things “Retarded”.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don’t see why this word by itself is milk nostril-evacuatingly side-splitting, you’re fucking retarded.<br/>\n<br/>\nConversation Exercises:<br/>\n<br/>\nActor A: “Hey man, that website you showed me the other day was so gay.”<br/>\n<br/>\nActor B: “You must be retarded. You’re so retarded, your grandmother was raped by fucking pirates.”<br/>\n<br/>\nActor A: “Don’t say shit about my grandmother. She WAS a pirate. Trained by secret ninjas to do some totally un-gay moves on retarded gay people like you.”<br/>\n<br/>\nActor B: “I’d appreciate you not bringing my sexual orientation into this.”<br/>\n<br/>\nActor A: “Sorry.”<br/>\n<br/>\nActor B: “You know, I think you’re right. That website is pretty gay.”<br/>\n<br/>\nLesson Summary:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe themes in this lesson you have noticed, and indeed the key most Internet-driven humor, are:<br/>\n- Mentioning things. By mentioning funny things, you seem funny.<br/>\n- Use 2 hilarious words a lot.<br/>\n- Communicate poorly developed opinions with those words.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a little practice, these rudimentary skills will be yours. Try using Google to dig up a picture of a ninja for your e-journal. Use the word “gay” to describe the next movie you see, even if you like it. Oh man, I’m laughing already!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nMay 07, 2010 - May 26, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Bifurcation in broad personality type. The 4 character designs were drawn before page 1, so things were very loose back then. I left it open, and the cross-similarities between pairs, specifically between Jade and John, led me to get some steam behind the idea that these two very vaguely had \"something to do with each other\".<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat they had to do with each other was something pieced together very organically over the development of the plot. We saw they shared identical towers on the same moon. The logic that they had something to do with each other naturally led to the same principle for Rose and Dave. They got a moon too.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of stuff is all so gradual, and pieced together from so many smaller events, it's hard to pinpoint exactly when an idea originally took shape.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the idea that they all had that origin was not pulled out of thin air. It was in the works for a good while, and a lot of foundation was laid for it. I would say it had its beginnings when I first introduced the concept of ectobiology, in Rose's next door lab when she made an unsuccessful paradox clone, a two headed cat. The thoughts weren't far off then, like \"Maybe this weird way of cloning someone is how the kids were made? Maybe for that matter they created themselves?\" Doesn't get more paradoxical than that, and thus wholly in the spirit of the fictional science, and in the spirit of the slowly rolling thunder that is this work's accumulating cache of themes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I think was sold it for me was when I got the idea to mix the pairs of slime from their respective guardians. The whole weird mess struck me as an especially novel origin story, and the thought of making these 8 babies all at once was just ridiculous enough to be irresistible. Not just because of the mad science/time travel/paradoxical novelty, but because of the new light it put the characters under. Especially the guardians I think. These weird automaton-like authority figures, mostly obstacles in the early going, are quite probably very much like the kids, just at different stages in their weird lives (i.e. the ones where they lose their facial features). They're all kind of like siblings in a way, even if not all biological. (Though some are!) And I think you could pick up on that from some of the early interactions, that for instance Rose was likely a very similar person to her mom. Her mom just happened to be an adult!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe origin story also lent a lot more relevance to John's designated handle, exctoBiologist. This was never something that was supposed to be significant at all. It was some funny word that tied into his interest of ghosts, and Ghostbusters. (The word was also lifted from an old comic I wrote.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut now that seems like it was extremely important from the getgo, like it was all FORESHADOWIN' AND SHIT. But of course it's just yet again me connecting another one of these million dots to some others, when the dots were never actually meant to be connected.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think very few major developments are pulled out of thin air, even if they appear to come from out of nowhere. There is almost always some foundational work for it. These things arrive through the series of details which lead to their cognition in the first place. You can always trace it backwards and find the clues that were pointing to it all along.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nMay 23, 2010 - June 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

There was no major plot to satisfy, other than escaping an office, and defeating this monster.<br/>\n<br/>\nHS has a complicated plot. It is an actual story, and will be wrapped up the way actual stories are meant to be. Will there be service to the gaming parallels present in HS too, as there were with the strife pages? Sure. But an infinite boss fight serves no purpose in this context other than to aggravate an audience. It was ok in Problem Sleuth because there was nothing more to it than that. The battle was a purpose unto itself, strung together with the ridiculous and the surreal and the absurd.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJune 8, 2010 - June 22, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

It's really hard to pinpoint where exactly major developments originated from.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it started from the very simple fact that the two pairs of kids looked similar, and had some profile similarities. And then there was the fact that John's nanna looked to Jade, and her grandpa looked like John. This begged the obvious question, are nanna/granpa actually Jade/John sent back in time??? Which is so obvious, it would be stupid if it panned out like that. So i think creating an explanation for that presented a challenge. An explanation that was somewhat original and completely unexpected, but made sense and used the existing parameters of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was also a ridiculous drawing I did which was a satirical crack pairing of Rose's mom and Dave's bro, just cause the idea of those two together seemed so absurd.

There's not much drama inherent in guarding their future events heavily, because again, we were brought into this with knowledge of where they wind up, and how a generic game session works.

It's really nothing like that at all anymore, and the real power of Flash in this format, for this particular story, I think has been revealed to be in adding serious cinematic power to the major moments, and not littering the more run of the mill content with funny little Flash tidbits and short musical interruptions. Not that I think the early content that had that stuff was bad. Not at all. It was all a great part of this thing's evolution.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat stuff doesn't really feel right for where this thing is now though. Like strife pages, mini games, 20 second musical interludes, etc. And effort is a factor here. There comes a time when effort has to be conserved to make sure everything that's happening is contributing constructively to an ultimate conclusion. Doing something like a strife page now would feel like WAY too much of a diversion when looking at the effort required. That wasn't a factor on the slow build up to this though. In fact doing stuff like that was part of the point of the build. To find out what this mixed media story experience could be. So pushing boundaries with Flash for some not especially critical content was perfectly suitable.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJune 30, 2010 - July 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

I'll accept the premise for a moment, and start rambling.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I actually remember when I realized I WASN'T funny. It was a really long time ago, maybe when I was in high school. And I drew some dumb bullshit comics of some vaguely humorous nature and assumed they were objectively funny because they were meant to be. They were \"funnies\". And those are automatically funny.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then a little later I took a look at those comics. One series was about a singing snail, and I guess there were some others. And I thought, \"Holy shit, this isn't funny at all. What was I thinking?\" And then later, gradually, I put a more concerted effort into understanding what is funny. I think it was a pretty slow climb. It was also a gradual process of becoming less of a dumbass. Dumbasses think stupid shit is funny, and that can be a major handicap.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest key to being funny is to not be a dumbass. Really stupid people have a hard time being funny (intentionally). The smarter you are, the better the odds you have of being funny. Note that sometimes you run into really smart people who aren't funny, or lack a sense of humor. But note, this is VERY STRONG evidence that they are not nearly as smart as they appear to be! In my view at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I equate humor as a product of intelligence, I mean it is primarily a product of awareness. The more you are aware of, and the more insight you have into a myriad of things, the more you will be able to successfully illuminate absurdity, and the more clever ways to accomplish this you will be able to conceive of. Awareness lends itself to an agile imagination. This is why stupidity is such comedic poison. Awareness of the world and that from which you draw your satirical muse is deadened by the mind-blunting forces that are associated with stupidity. These forces primarily are a lack of concentration and dedication, and inalertness to all that surrounds you and all content you are exposed to. As well as being quick to judge and label whatever does manage to get through the pinhole. Those are brain killers and comedy killers. They lead to hackneyed work at best, and incredibly awful, prejudicial, bigoted stuff at worst.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I don't mean to say I'm a real smart guy and that's why I'm funny, or EVEN VICE VERSA. I'm just pointing out that, in thinking back, becoming less obtuse and deepening my understanding of as much as possible was a turning point in beginning to understand what is and isn't funny.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJuly 9, 2010 - July 14, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

All I can say is, this arc is serving the exact purpose it needs to serve for the bigger picture, and it'll take exactly as long as it needs to take. If the issue is it's too much of a tangential slowdown from the main story, all I can do is point to the fact that all of Homestuck is constructed almost exclusively of meandering garden paths. Even though these are new characters in a completely different place and time, there's not much new here. This sort of thing has happened before. Introducing WV in act 2 seemed like a massive detour at the time, but later its tremendous relevance was illuminated. In hindsight, I don't think impatience has ever been warranted or vindicated.

But we really had a long time to get used to her speech pattern. Plenty of conversations before the troll arc. The letters are caps, matching the size of the numbers for increased readability (deliberate).<br/>\n<br/>\nParsing these is just a matter of flipping a switch in your head, on just a few characters, which bear pretty strong resemblance to those they stand for.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow I understand if this still isn't ideal for perfectly comfortable reading, and I wouldn't want to read a whole book like that for instance, but when you take into account the \"hard ones\" will occupy probably less than 20% of all dialogue, this whole issue is just dumb.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't roll my eyes hard enough at complaints about this.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJuly 9, 2010 - July 14, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

And sometimes (as in that case) it was actually slower to do it that way than it would be to just draw it from scratch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is an idea which is behind reusing visuals like that, much like I reused the shot of Dave lying on the ground using his iPhone to show a crippled Tavros doing the exact same thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe idea is tied to the huge volume of textual callbacks, reusing phrases from the narrative and bits of dialogue, tweaking them sometimes. This happens probably more than anyone realizes. You could possibly read the story ten times and not catch them all. Nothing is safe from reuse. The thing is a litany of a thousand refrains, visual, verbal and conceptual.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what is the idea? I don't feel like elaborating on it THAT much now, because I would probably type forever. Basically, it's about building an extremely dense interior vocabulary to tell a story with, and continue to build and expand that vocabulary by revisiting its components often, combining them, extending them and so on. A vocabulary can be (and usually is) simple, consisting of single words, but in this case it extends to entire sentences and paragraph structures and visual forms and even entire scenes like the one linked above. Sometimes the purpose for reiteration is clear, and sometimes there really is no purpose other than to hit a familiar note, and for me that's all that needs to happen for it to be worthwhile. Triggering recognition is a powerful tool for a storyteller to use. Recognition is a powerful experience for a reader. It promotes alertness, at the very least. And in a lot of cases here, I think it promotes levity (humor! this is mostly a work of comedy, remember.) Controlling a reader's recognition faculty is one way to manipulate the reader's reactions as desired to advance the creative agenda. In this case I'm not exactly sure what that agenda is all the time, and in truth there probably isn't any serious agenda there. This story, though at times seeming diabolically put together, is still pretty light reading after all. if anything I'm just striving for a certain pitch in density with the all the multithreaded symbolism and endless internal reference. Think of it as a symphony and everything I've referred to as belonging to a vocabulary are really just notes, working together in a really complicated harmonic structure.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJuly 20, 2010 - July 28, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Even if you don't agree, if you did, would you consider it a bad thing?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nNo, and I don't disagree. But we need to consider some TRU-FACTS;<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could never launch into a story like this cold turkey. You could but it would be really difficult, forcing people to swallow a lot at once. I do think in some way Hivebent stands alone reasonably well, but part of what makes it compelling is the massive pre-education the reader had on the way up to this point. There are so many complex concepts that can now be taken for granted, while we explore a completely different story with new characters, without spending time developing those grounding concepts which is what we were doing for much of the preceding acts.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet those concepts are still being elaborated on all the same, through this totally new context. Part of the point of this (the MANY points) is to continue to develop the game they're playing, and demonstrate its incredible flexibility and how many ways it could possibly go. By showing an example of extreme difference, 12 players instead of 4, prototyping a bunch of monsters instead of silly things, how many different fanciful worlds there can be and how the political scene with the kingdoms can play out so differently, we're given a much better sense of this than when we were just told it. Showing this helps the reader continue to extrapolate through imagination the various ways this game could go, and also helps put in perspective how the kids' game is going and how off model they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a lot of purpose to this arc beyond serving as a cool tangent. Every step of the way we are constantly altering our perspective on what the main protagonists are facing. And when we finally come out of the woods of this thing and get back into the kids' story, our perspective will be completely different from where we left it. And I'm quite sure whatever unique energy is building in the Hivebent story, that will carry over to Homestuck proper when we pick it up again.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that said, I think it's cool to be able to tell a story like this in the middle of something fairly unlike it. To essentially inject a humorous scifi world-building tale, follow the complex lives of alien kids on a planet without adult supervision, raised by monsters, all playing a game over the internet. That's a fun premise, and it just wouldn't be the same if not nested inside a bigger story that already did so much of the dirty work. It would be a lot harder to pull off by itself.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJuly 31, 2010 - Aug 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Regardless, for everyone person who dislikes how long the Hivebent arc has been going on, I'd say there's three of us who like what you've done with it. It's engaging and cool to read. OH CRAP NEED A QUESTION howru?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nYou know, there has been some buzzin' about it and what not, but I think the truth is it was never actually that controversial.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've sampled reactions to it all over the place, and it always stuck me as quite a small pocket of the overall audience that ever had any dissatisfaction with it. The same was also true at the beginning of Homestuck. It was a very different thing, and a few people here and there got really restless about it, and swore up and down that MSPA had crested with Problem Sleuth. And of course these sentiments were not in the least bit vindicated in the long run, once we stopped being up so close and personal with the tree of Act 1, and got a little distance from the forest that is HS. I've regarded the vocal minority's present dissatisfaction as the exact same thing. It hasn't deterred me in the least, and even though the recent \"AH trolls the fans\" thing seems like a strong rebuke of this dissent, it's really very mild one, if one at all. It is meant as playful and humorous.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow on the FLIPSIDE of this, there is significant group of people that really liked the change in direction this arc presented. In fact, rather than functioning as a drag on the readership's interest, I have observed the opposite. The troll stuff has been like pouring rocket fuel on the fandom. Daily traffic has only gone UP since it started. More people than ever seem to be energetically buzzing about what's going on, debating the merits of the characters and the nature of the alien world, drawing more fan art than I could ever possibly keep track of, creating troll personas and stuff like that. These are not the typical results of making a mistake in a story's direction.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of, \"Was the troll arc, and to some extent the existence of the trolls altogether, really an elaborate set up as a long con to troll the readers?\"<br/>\n<br/>\nYes and no. There is a little truth to it, in the sense that creating alien kid characters who were both internet trolls, AND literal trolls could very well have been a kind of racial avatarization of my own semi-trolling tendencies as an author, which had been on display well before their appearance. Psyche-outs, cagey self referential stuff and the like, it's all a little spunky, and I remain aware of this, and this stuff does fall into a certain class of trolling. Totally granted.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that became much more tangible with the introduction of the trolls. Everything about the trolls was always at least a little antagonizing with varying degrees of playfulness, both to the other characters, and to the reader as well. Their text is a bit difficult to parse (Not impossible! Just enough to make you aware of additional reading effort.) They are all a little ornery, and as it turns out, excessively emotional. Their role in the plot is one of bumbling sabotage and interference with the protagonists. And finally, in maybe the most trollish display yet, their entire introduction through a \"detour arc\" clearly is a bit agitating to anyone eager to see some of these cliffhangers resolved. It's entirely in the spirit of the indentation they have already made on the story. The reader can either fight it (trolls win!) or roll with it and embrace it on the terms it's presented. (Trolls still win.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd even within the arc, there are numerous explorations of the trolling theme, like addressing topics that are sure to get people worked up. Examining topics like juggalos, furry fetish porn, shipping, and intricate studies on sci-fi romance, ultimately spiraling into soap opera plot dynamics and character interactions, heavy with conversational drama and teenage histrionics. It's all fuel for getting readers riled up a bit, and if you read it and get this itchy, agitated feeling in the back of your mind, that sensation is called \"being trolled\".<br/>\n<br/>\nSORT OF.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this should be taken literally as a head-on attempt to troll the reader. It's just not that black and white. The purpose here is still entertainment, and humor, and advancing the plot in ways that have not become clear yet. I think in working on the troll stuff I have learned a little about my own policy toward satire. It's never absolute. Everything I mock is always embraced in some way. The juggalo character, Gamzee, is a good example of this. When he was introduced as a juggalo, people could see the writing on the wall. Here we go, time to do the juggalo shtick and laugh at how ridiculous juggalos are and their weird trashy culture and everything. And we did do that, to an extent! But after the initial !?! moment of revealing a juggalo and getting all hot and bothered about it, that material actually began to be incorporated at face value. It was folded into his character profile, and he turned out to be a pretty lovable guy who likes clowns and a particular beverage, and embraces the memetic affiliation juggalos have with miracles as a form of spirituality. In no way is the character a referendum on how ridiculous and lame juggalos are anymore, or how much we should all think ICP sucks. In fact, in a weird way, he starts to embody a CELEBRATION of those elements. Which to be honest, I think is a pretty good way to handle satire. The same is true, in varying degrees, of the inclusion of fandoms' zeal for shipping (Nepeta), weird horse porn (Equius), LARPing, delving into highly emotional, overwrought romantic intrigue, and so on. All of it is handled in a tongue in cheek manner, as satirical fodder, BUT ALSO played totally straight in some respects, as raw material to define the characters and build the story in a way that takes the elements at face value. With MSPA I am always on the lookout for raw material to manipulate in esoteric ways, and its usually garnered through satire. But then I ride that material pretty hard, and before you even know what's going on, it's not satirical anymore! Ask yourself this: at what point did John's love of Con Air cease to be a mockery of the film, and became more of a SHRINE to it? Hard to say.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat doesn't mean we lose sight of the fact that this stuff is ridiculous. It's still plenty ridiculous. The juggalo movement still strikes me as awfully silly, and so does overzealous shipping. The thing is, we can mock stuff and that's fine. It doesn't mean that stuff demands excessive scorn, or can't be treated as a legitimate topic to roll with in a story. So I think drawing your own horse porn is pretty weird. But who am I to say that's REALLY so terrible? I'm not better than anybody. I'll poke fun at it for a while, but then I'll just roll with horse dicks with a straight face for a while too. Maybe have a beer with them. Turns out they're a good bunch of dicks when you get to know 'em!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd pretty clearly, all of this is followed through with acute self-awareness, which is probably just a kind of handicap I have to live with. I just can't help but be aware of everything I do and all the reasons I'm doing them and apply intense scrutiny to those reasons, and it's very hard for me to feign obliviousness. I guess I'm not that interested in trying. As such, MSPA has always been a pretty meta thing, and from time to time we'll blur into things like troll Andrew. I try to keep it fun. Personally, I find it funny. Spiking Cal is probably one of my favorite pages at this point.<br/>\n<br/>\nBooyeah.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, also the wolf. I like the wolf page.<br/>\n<br/>\nAaaaaaaah.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nAug 22, 2010 - Sep 7, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Do you think there are any legitimate complaints that get lost in the trend of \"THIS ISN'T PROBLEM SLEUTH 2 SO IT SUCKS\"? More generally, do you perceive any failures in your execution so far?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nI'm not immune to criticism nor do I regard my work as perfect at all. It has plenty of flaws and by and large I know what they are.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstanding these flaws already might make me seem \"immune\", or at least indifferent to criticism. I can't recall being blindsided by an intelligent criticism which hadn't already occurred to me myself. Usually I look at a decision from a lot of angles, examine the pitfalls, and often proceed in spite of the pitfalls for whatever reasons I have. There are always reasons behind these judgments. Also a lot of what happens with MSPA is a learning process based on experimental approach. Experimentation is often what informs decisions against more universally sound creative judgment. But when the dust has settled after a certain experimental phase, I generally have all the faults with it well in hand, and many of them were anticipated. I can see myself what worked and didn't work so well. By the time a critic comes knocking they aren't telling me anything new. I've already spent ten times longer thinking about it than he has. Probably longer. Anyone trying to school me on this stuff frankly is just barking up the wrong tree.<br/>\n<br/>\nImplicit in this is that I often agree with critics, especially if they really \"got it\". I agree qualitatively. What I don't agree with is critical editorializing. And example of a qualitative observation would be \"this is a bit wordy\" to which I respond \"yes I agree.\" Where we differ is when the critic feels the need to say \"and that's bad bad bad you should stop stop stop!\" to which I reply \"no no no!\" Because obviously I already thought it through and accepted the consequences of that decision. It is what I wanted it to be, and exactly what I thought it would be, pitfalls and all, for reasons I can articulate if needed. Demanding critics want more from you though. They wish for concessions to their point of view. It seems more emotional than logical.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany critics are very naive in this sense, and these people I would not even regard as real critics at all. More like just complainers. They leverage their dissatisfaction under the guise of criticism, and if their grievances are dismissed, the creator is accused of being deaf to criticism. A little like suitors spurned by a woman will accuse her of being icy. Creators have a responsibility to vet their critics, to know how deep the critic's appreciation and understanding of the material is first before putting value on their advice. To understand whether the critic is capable of quality thought and observation. To apply a critical process to the critic itself. Some critics believe they themselves are immune to criticism! Not all opinions and perspectives are equal, and it's dangerous and incredibly stupid for creators to treat them as such. Would you take advice on how to improve your life from a retarded person? You see, we actually do this every day. We vet those who would counsel us on our daily lives, who we would trust to guide us in the right direction.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nSep 09, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Wouldn't the other Prospit trolls be blinded by Skaia then? And Kanaya with the sun? What?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nYou seem to be making this more complicated than it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, if you stare at the sun for a while, you go blind. Even if that's not 100% technically true, that's the reality everyone understands. You don't need to be especially photosensitive.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Terezi stared at the sun, her real self went blind. This is a simple fact.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen her dream self stared at Skaia, this is open to interpretation. Does staring into the heart of Skaia for a while cause your dream self to go blind? Maybe staring at it in conjunction with your real self staring at the sun is what does it? OR! Maybe staring at Skaia doesn't make your dream self go blind at all. Maybe her dream self went blind simply because her real self did, and like she explained to Karkat, her mental self image kept the blindness in her dreams because she wanted to be that way, because it helped her continue to connect with her lusus and learn a new way to see. There are a number of ways to look at this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe psychic relay that made her sleepwalk also involves some subtleties. (Though this wasn't actually part of the question.)<br/>\n<br/>\nVriska commandeered Tavros's mind to get him to use his psychic powers. That's pretty obvious. He then communed with Terezi's dragon. The dragon then connected with the mind of sleeping Terezi. But what happens then does not appear to be straightup mind control, as Vriska usually employs. Terezi was happily sleepwalking along, not proceeding with the zombie shuffle that mind control victims usually exhibit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems that the dragon's psychic ability was used to influence Terezi in a more subtle way, without issuing firm commands. More like a suggestion. It suggested in her dream that she get up, look into the sky and open her eyes. This is simultaneously implementing Vriska's revenge ploy by getting her real self to sleepwalk and look at the sun, as well as implementing the dragon's primal intent to get Terezi's dream self to become aware of Skaia and wake up. Her unhatched dragon, as a sort of mystical guide, presumably is aware of Skaia and her fate, and continues to act as such as it teaches her to see while blind in her dreams.<br/>\n<br/>\nVriska simply used the dragon's unharnessed impulse to do this as a matter of convenience, working under the constraints she had. She may have had this contingency prepared in advance even, much like Terezi had a plan prepared to take Vriska out utilizing Scratch.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nSep 09, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

How long have you been waiting to spring that on us?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nSince before Homestuck started.<br/>\n<br/>\nHS was always going to be a story about an extremely elaborate creation myth. As elaborate as I could conceive. In the HS reality, Sburb/Sgrub is the means by which universes procreate. Planets and civilizations are the seeds from which one or many new universes will blossom if the players succeed, at the expense of the life on that planet.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was always what Homestuck was about. This revelation was carefully guarded, although there are plenty of clues. It has taken 4.5 acts to understand the \"what\" (as well as some of the \"how\" along the way.) The rest of the story will be about exploring the rest of the \"how\", as well as determining whether the players succeed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've answered numerous times that the conception of HS had its roots in loosely combining the themes and feel of Earthbound, The Sims, and Spore. That was a formula concocted many months before I began the story, well before Problem Sleuth was finished. The story still strikes me as staying very close to that original vision. Only now does the Spore component seems like it makes more sense. \"Sburb\" was always a word that was supposed to be reminiscent of \"Spore\", tweaked to reference the house building element as well. Spore is about universe building, and more specifically, life form and civilization building, but from the microscopic to the macroscopic. Sburb is the reverse. The goal is to create a universe all at once after overcoming an extensive series of challenges, and as is implied, the universe fleshes itself out with galaxies and systems and planets and lifeforms, ready and waiting for entry by the victorious players. The ultimate reward is for the players to enter the universe they created and do as they see fit. They are essentially the gods of that universe, and that is what the trolls are to our universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe trolls were always meant to serve this purpose. Before I conceptualized them in any way at all, their primary description was \"the group of players who created our universe by successfully completing Sburb, and who would interact with the kids in some way and help them understand the purpose of the game\". Logically, the other group of players would have to be aliens, since they are not only from a different planet, but from an entirely different universe. This began the thought process that lead to making them trolls, and then specifically, internet trolls who would harass the kids, but ultimately support them as the group of veteran players who understood what was going on better than any of the kids. This was mainly solidified because I thought the concept of our universe being created by a bunch of cantankerous internet trolls was a funny idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the time I didn't expect to get as deep into their story as I eventually did. I figured I'd touch upon it in some limited way, and only introduce a handful of characters, and just keep trucking along with the kids. But as their story became more entangled with the kids' story, it felt more necessary to just go all the way and get into their adventure, not just to better contextualize and characterize them all, but as a sort of accelerated primer on the entire game objective itself. The story is certainly about four kids and their adventure together, but also at its heart, it is about this esoteric creation myth, and the troll arc became a good way to establish the true objective while getting a foothold of the scope and magnitude of it all. We got a different look at how another session could go, with a much different player count and personality ensemble, and all the ways that could contribute to variations in this highly flexible game, and ultimately what the point of all this is. All this diversity and flexibility in the game's unfolding presumably has a bearing on what type of universe will be created. These ideas will be explored in detail over the remainder of the story. There's a lot more to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe deeper I've gone into involving the trolls in the story, the more it seems to me they were never an element I could really just shrug off in favor of focusing on \"the real story\". The process of going through their story has had an effect in showing the nature of the game that could never have been achieved without going down that road. Without it, I'd have to resort to a more mundane expository means of revealing the game's purpose. The Felt intermission, which certainly seemed tangential (and surely was) still served an important purpose by helping us invest in the villainous nature of Jack Noir. Without that, his future actions would have much less meaning. Similarly, the troll arc has served to more thoroughly \"characterize\" the entire purpose of the game, and give it much more meaning going forward. Furthermore, the troll story is inextricably entwined with the kids. Actions of the kids had influence over the way the troll adventure unfolded, and therefore the way their own universe was created (Rose's gamefaqs, the scratch they create, just to name what we know of). The kids' adventure is obviously heavily influenced by the trolls through direct communication, and therefore the trolls have a hand in causing the kids to do whatever it was they did to impact the troll's adventure, and so on. Willingly or not, they're all working toward the same outcome, toward creating our universe, and the universe the kids are trying to create, and whatever trouble puts all that in jeopardy. Remember that both the kids' and the trolls' chum handles are needed to make the full set of ACGT combinations. They are not two unrelated groups of players as they first appeared, nor are their universes unrelated. Sollux's shades, the ~ATH code, etc help illustrate this, that they are bifurcated, interwoven realities.<br/>\n<br/>\nEven Act 5 is a microcosm of this idea. It is a bifurcated act. Act 5.1 is the troll half. Act 5.2 is the kid half. 5.2 even begins with two sets of curtains, red and blue. Blue symbolizes the troll universe, red symbolizes our universe. First we crossed through blue, then red.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne last thing I'll mention about all this. The whole creation myth angle of Homestuck was almost entirely inspired by the ludicrous creation myth in Problem Sleuth, the way GPI used his imaginary time traveling duplicates to create all the matter in the universe. I think that was one of my personal favorite ideas to come out of that story, in terms of scope and absurdity. So when I was considering ideas for the next story, I thought it would be fun to develop that topic further, but with a little less absurdity and more depth, sophistication and complexity. And for the creation myth to exist as the centerpiece of the game purpose and story.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nSep 19, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

They would certainly feel like it, having made the universe and then going wherever they wanted, existing as very powerful warriors from all their battle experience and high grade gear.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other entities and forces in this multiverse reality that could be seen as more god-like. The many instances of Skaia, for one. Whatever it is, exactly. The more sinister outer gods. Omnipotent beings like English, Scratch, Snowman, Bec. The mysterious frog god briefly mentioned, \"Bilious Slick\". All this stuff alludes to a pretty lively scene beyond the grasp of mortals. Players of the game appear to be just more pawns in the process of perpetuating reality. They're heroes, sure. And their stories likely wind up being the most interesting in this reality. But they're still just a bunch of mortal kids.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we do see evidence that their story elevates them to godhood in the mythology of the people who eventually populate the universe they create. The constellations in our zodiac are just arbitrary looking star clusters, but people in our history saw them as symbols of the 12 creators, and built a whole mystical framework around their story. The specifics of the story may have been lost over time, or may never have been known. It could just be that the way our universe was created is imprinted in their subconscious, and it surfaces symbolically in their stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was actually my line of thinking in writing Rose's wizardfic. If you sift through that dense excerpt, you find it's about 12 evil kids who played a role in influencing every dark event in history. My intent was that this was her subconsciously echoing the creation story of her own universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could also extend their influence to the personality profiles of the characters. There are a lot of similarities between the profiles of many of the trolls and the kids. Some trolls seem to share traits with more than one kid. This is to be expected to some extent, since some of the profile elements are pretty broad. But in some cases the crossover is harder to ignore, and this could be attributed to the Alternian heroes laying the psychological tracks for the heroes that arise in the universe they create. But that said, I didn't want to get too carried away with this idea, and just make the \"Dave version\" of the trolls, and so on. So I drew similarities at times, and exaggerated differences at others, hoping to strike a balance.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nSep 19, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

The trend had already been present in HS, with increasing importance given to pesterlogs to drive the story, and I've found the consequences to be interesting, and not really expected from the onset of HS.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo Hivebent represents more of a verbal push, I guess in part as a media exploration. It's not too inaccurate to describe it as a very vividly illustrated e-novel. I understand of course this is not what 100% of all readers have a strong appetite for, and that's fine with me. Reading through HS and then hitting Hivebent is a little like suddenly encountering thicker atmosphere in flight. The rate of progress slows, it demands a little more attention, and then when you get through it, the pace picks back up. (Probably!) Overall, I'm satisfied with how it turned out, and it reads pretty much how I thought it would. It just lasted a couple months longer than I projected, because I will absolutely never be able to pin down an accurate time estimate on a story arc. I have resolved to stop trying, ever.<br/>\n<br/>\nText-heavy visual storytelling is something I've thought about recently beyond the scope of this arc, and I think there are some interesting possibilities to explore. Perhaps I will, but I doubt what I'd have in mind would be compatible with the MSPA format. Perhaps after HS. We'll see.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nSep 19, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

I understand using that format for Hivebent, but now that we're with the kids must we still have micro-time jumps and have every statement be enigmatic? What happened to the slow build and discovery?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nWhat's the deal with the phrase \"what's the deal with\"? The deal with it is what you see and read. That's how it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nWere you expecting absolute reversion to earlier story progression rhythms? You were wrong to do so. What is it about this story, this format, or this website which would make you anticipate static, unevolving patterns? Is there criticism and disapproval buried in your question? [Yes.] That's cool. But if you've made it this far, you should now be familiar with the concept of storytelling in a state of perpetual flux. Your observation strikes me as a little obtuse.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the reader is well prepared for every shift in the nature of the story's unfolding. There are primers on what to expect along the way. Very early, when we first met Dave, we began a humble exercise in non-linear pacing. Conversations he had with John and Rose, then revisited from an earlier timeframe from his perspective. Some nonlinear revisitations with Jade's story as well. It wasn't just messing around. It established that time was something to be tinkered with in this story, more intensively as we progress. The MC intermission was a primer on complicated time travel dynamics taking center stage in the story. It was a tangent, quite silly and convoluted, but very good preparation for the concepts to follow, which have dominated the story since. The troll arc was a very aggressive primer on completely off the rails nonlinear story progression, which has somewhat extended beyond it into the main story, and will continue to do so. All of these primer concepts are now firing on all cylinders at once. And the word primer is the title of a very complicated time travel movie, which I have not seen yet. I imagine watching it would serve as a decent primer for reading Homestuck.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is what the story is. There is no \"real story\" I need to \"get back to\" as you imply.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nOct 15, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

It got a little out of hand with feature sprawl, as should be painfully predictable to me by now.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary purpose of this idea initially was to create a simple, fun format emulating RPG gameplay, particularly the sort of moments where you explore a village, talk to as many people as you can, and start piecing together clues for the game's story bit by bit. I thought it would be a good way to load up on a lot of cross-interaction between many different characters without resorting to a huge linear dump of extensive pesterlogs. And it was successful in this sense. I just thought it would be easier, involving a few character sprites, a few room tiles, a simple adaptation of Alexis's existing Flash engine, and a whole lot of writing by me (that part still turned out to be true).<br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end I think it was worth it to go a little extra further with it and come closer to capturing a more immersive feel to playing an RPG like this. Learning about story details in this manner is something so many people are very familiar with. Anyone who's ever even casually played RPGs has spent many hours doing it. And yet it feels strikingly novel to me in this context, encountering a page like this and switching your mindset on how you're being fed information necessary to advance the story. Suddenly the burden is on you to take action and piece the full picture together yourself. It's a little like doing detective work. Which is exactly what it's like exploring a village in an RPG. The various NPCs lurking around town are always alluding to things, rarely being all that explicit. Alluding to some peril in another town which might ring a bell if you've already visited that town, or will ring a bell later when you eventually do. Or talking to a person on one side of town whose story connects with a person on the other side. It's a pretty interesting angle on storytelling, that is to say, having to account for the reader's free will over data intake, which is a complete non-issue outside of interactive media, and one we probably take for granted as a story building method because we're not really thinking of it that way when playing a game. The purpose is to explore and advance, not to be led through narrative as we're accustomed to in other formats. And yet, after fully exploring a town, the end result is similar to having read a coherent story. You proceed armed with details and references which will prepare you for later story events.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it does seem to be a pretty effective way to paint a portrait of a situation. Even more so when you aren't mining information from flat, monologuing NPCs, but established characters having back and forth conversations. It's probably hard for me to be objective about this since I'm up to my neck in it, but after playing all the way through, I get the feeling that even someone who knew nothing about the story or the characters would have a pretty good sense for what was going on after running through it all. They're aliens, stranded on a meteor, hiding from a demon, discovering another race called humans with their computers, conversing with their past/future selves, each with allusions to a distinct backstory, many characters with clear types of preexisting relationships with each other, and so on. There's really a ton of information conveyed through this, directly and through inference, without any exposition, and all absorbed very rapidly through a universally friendly, accessible format.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nOct 27, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Ahhh I don't get it. :/\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nIt's not what it's supposed to evoke. You've made the classic blunder of mistaking your point of view for objective reality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's fair to say the style just doesn't sit well with you, and that's true of some other people as well. But entangled with this issue is that it's something new and unexpected projected against something much simpler, as well as against everything we're used to seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be those who are squeamish about sudden changes, and those people will absolutely never cop to it. They will always suggest their dissatisfaction is not because a thing is different, but because a thing is BAAAAAAAAD, and they'll have their laundry list of points to prove it, and they'll come packing hyperbole just to make sure you're TOTALLY convinced.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe bias of anti-change corrupts the critical faculty. This story is built on perpetual change and evolution. This is a drill I'm very familiar with. So I have a hard time taking detractors seriously, and as usual, put a lot more stock in my own judgment.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt gets particularly ridiculous when fielding issues about the merits of an art style from people who obviously know nothing about art. The truth behind the situation is some folks got \"squicked\" by the contextual delivery of a different style, and then rationalize the reaction by identifying all these problems with the art completely independent of the context in which their reaction occurred, through the lens of someone who's never given two shits about serious artistic analysis.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo maybe there are some iffy things going on with anatomy? Stylistic misfires in the features? Alright, maybe this is fair to discuss. Even though really breaking down one of these images is sort of missing the bigger point here, this is what I had to say about one drawing for the record.<br/>\n<br/>\n-----<br/>\n\"Is it a clinic on human anatomy? Of course not. Sort of an absurd standard to hold it to. It is, like many drawings, a balance between accuracy and stylization. It's a slightly exaggerated \"gawking pose\", because of course the laptop is on the ground, and she's presumably now sitting on the ground and stooping lower to see it. It furthermore conveys body language I thought was appropriate for A) a gangly awkward teenager, and B) someone nonplussed by a ridiculous internet conversation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a bit of wonkiness to the stylization mixed in with the amped realism. The edges are chewed up a little more than usual. Stray pixels and 1-pixel lines dart in and out of forms. This is not an immaculate presentation, and by design. But the anatomy is roughly accurate regardless, for what it is. The virtual spine does indeed connect with the base of the virtual skull where it should, given the posture. The face, from a semi-realistic comic stylization standpoint is absolutely nothing out of the ordinary. The mouth is conveyed as slightly open through minimalism.\"<br/>\n-----<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is getting down to the artistic issues in an intelligent way, and you may agree or disagree, but like I said, this is sort of missing the bigger point. For one thing, in what has been an obvious exercise in visual/stylistic volatility all along, to hold yet another emergent style to such scrutiny or as something that doesn't belong strikes me as a little petty in the grand scheme of things, as a willful misapprehension of the nature of the work, and as just another instance of \"change allergy\" rearing its head. Just another missed opportunity for that omnipresent group of people who can never manage to just roll with something when it's introduced rather than gnashing their teeth about it, eventually get used to it, and then later pretend they were down with it all along.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this isn't even what bugs me about it. You can dislike a drawing I did. I don't care about that at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I find really irritating is when troglodytes from the internet chirp up and bombastically suggest their judgment is better than mine when it comes to the aesthetic direction of this thing, or really any kind of direction for that matter. It's like they managed to forget whose judgment brought the thing they presumably enjoy to where it is in the first place. I don't like it whenever I get the sense that Homestuck is a sacred cow in the mind of a reader, and if I do something \"wrong\", I'm kicking that cow. It doesn't belong to you. The cow is mine, and you are enjoying its milk at my discretion.<br/>\n<br/>\nVehement detractors will almost certainly contribute to my inclination to continue to produce what upsets them, likely more so than I initially intended, and this has been the case since the start of Homestuck. Bored by sylladex shenanigans? Get ready for a lot more fucking around. Impatient with the troll arc? Whoops, time to slow it down! Uh oh, don't like detailed drawings that much? Hmmmmmm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I actually manage to jettison the disgruntled parties from the readership, I consider that an added bonus. Like spiking the football after the touchdown.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat dude dancing in the end zone over there? That's the MVP.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nOct 29, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Staying the course with your vision doesn't mean you'll do everything right, but if included in that vision is serious, concerted exploration, you can only benefit as an artist. Adversaries to this cause should be regarded as villains.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are two ways to do the \"obstinate douche bag\" thing as an artist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne is in vehement defense of stagnation.

As an iconic style it can communicate different things than the other styles. For now, I've just resorted to it as a fresh look.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also used it as sort of a springboard to launch the more detailed style exploration. The main thought process was, if one hyper-simplified style was just introduced, why not another one on the opposite side of the spectrum? Hence the transition from one to the other, and now back and forth and dancing in between through subsequent pages. It's sort of a study of two extremes now in the arsenal as I move forward.

A movie would be cool though I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would have to be so different though as to be almost unrecognizable, other than what exists at the heart of the story. Which is about the four main characters, their relationships as internet friends, the themes involving coming of age and discovery through this fantastical game setting, and that's about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo much would have to be slashed, unless the thing sprawled into a monstrous trilogy, or N_logy. Most likely the casualties would include: everything about the trolls, everything about the post apocalypse exiles, vast amounts of fucking around with game mechanics, and probably even the kid/guardian relationships. It would require a complete redelivery of the concept of the game as a mechanism of creation myth.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis comes with the peril of being regarded as heresy, but I wouldn't view it that way, because like I said, it is an utter impossibility to capture what this is precisely through cinema, just as it would be through a book. But reformatting the work to fit different kinds of media I think is a challenge I'd embrace. I don't regard the exact details of the story as it is now as something all that precious. I think there are fundamentals beneath all that which are more important. I always saw HS as an exploration of young people developing relationships over the internet, which is something a lot of people reading it can relate to, and a concept sort of under-represented in fiction of all kinds. I've explored that from a lot of angles so far, at first with the kids amongst each other, delving into existing relationships, and then with the trolls, which has been an exploration of forging new ones, and in particular one of making friends out of adversaries. There's a lot more to HS than just that obviously, but if there's anything which it's been about through and through, it's modern kids relating to each other from afar, developing as people and growing up.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 04, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

But of course, I'm sure Tolkien's stuff had its share of Arthurian influence in there as well. It's hard to escape those archetypes when you're dealing with that material. Hell, maybe it was even part of the whole point for him. I don't actually know that much about LotR.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, does all this MEAN something?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have very lofty purposes for it. It's fun to connect an elaborate fantasy tale, especially one as whimsical as this, with points of mythology entrenched in modern culture and universally recognized. These are symbols we all recognize, and in this case sort of stand in for the grandeur of a multi-threaded quest which will not necessarily ever be at the forefront of what we're shown, or what the story treats as most important.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou might notice as you read that quest details are never all that important. There's a lot of stuff that's glossed over, conversed about casually, or even flippantly. Sometimes the characters even mock the quest details, making fun of the silly and useless puzzles they're meant to solve. That's because the quests are a backdrop to the more relevant focus of the story, which is the characters and their relationships, and the much heavier plot events that transcend the quest details. Like Noir's insurgence or Rose's commitment to game breaking. All the most important plot points have to to with the subversion of more conventional quest elements.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 04, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

It started in a series of donation commands, and I thought it would be fun to elaborate on them in this story. This began with their appearance on the MSPA website in the HS universe, which John and co. could read on their computers. The original rationale was that this is what MSPA looked like in an alternate universe, because I considered doing a Midnight Crew story for MSPA after PS ended, instead of HS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen this idea was further elaborated on when the MC was revealed to literally exist in a different universe, the one which the trolls lived in, and was the predecessor to our universe. In the HS universe, MSPA is a window to the story of the Midnight Crew taking place in the troll universe. In the troll universe, MSPA is the window to the Homestuck story taking place in the human universe. (though technically, they are windows to somewhat bastardized versions of those stories)<br/>\n<br/>\nThis idea was developed in tandem with casting Jack and the agents as key villains, and constants between sessions, in the same sense that Bowser is the same villain throughout the various Mario games, though he experiences a different fate depending on which game you play or how you play it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI never liked the idea of including canonical Problem Sleuth characters (aside from Snoop Dogg) in Homestuck. And the more popular appeal the idea seemed to have and the more people asked me about it or theorized about it, the less I liked it for some reason. At this point it's safe to say it just isn't going to happen.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 12, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

I work pretty fast because of this.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe end result is something complex through gradual accumulation, in a way that I try to make maniacally self consistent. But it's all built upon ideas that I spent a good deal of time thinking about and connecting before executing. Not moments before drawing, but in the days, weeks or months preceding, while I'm doing other things like walking around and running errands. Since all the key ideas already exist on sort of a road map in my head, executing becomes a pretty simple exercise, and allows for a lot of whimsy and snap decisions, as long as those decisions aren't in violation of the big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuffice to say, there isn't a lot of analysis that goes into the process.

Which is obviously a relatable set of circumstances for humans, even if the vernacular and cultural implications are different. So if they're talking about this stuff in a heated way, it's most likely about hearts/spades rather than clubs/diamonds.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on a side note, while we can certainly examine this stuff in a serious way as if engaging in a fictional sociological study, I feel it's important not to lose sight of the fact that this material is always meant to be rooted in humor. That's one of the big reason it exists in the first place, to set the stage for these ridiculous situations and absurd relationship dynamics and conflicts, with silly terms being thrown around leading to confusion. Much like a romantic comedy uses romantic tension we all understand to create ridiculous scenarios. This uses scifi romance principles to do the same. It's essentially a scifi romcom, but unlike a romcom which will usually at some point, if not frequently, place the romance ahead of the comedy for a sappy payoff, that's not what's going on here. I'd rather that humor always be in the forefront for HS. The details of troll romance, and all romance issues really, aren't meant to be taken all that seriously. It's all supposed to be pretty silly stuff. Romance is a foil for humor, to some extent character development, and little else.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 12, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Overlapping and double punching is a simple enough conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then, what do you do with the cards?<br/>\n<br/>\nPut them in a machine.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat machine?

And to have it all function as this sort of itemsmithing equivalent to something vaguely reminiscent of Platonic idealism. It was always meant to convey a truly esoteric forge, something a little otherworldly and in a way kind of sterile in aesthetic, like they were these odd modules of creative potential dropped from heaven. Or something.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the story's focus on that seems like a long time ago now, and since exploring that in depth and playing with it, we've moved on to a lot of other fun ideas and plot points, while those themes fell in the background, to be revisited very occasionally. Mostly now the whole system serves as something the reader understands already, and items are manufactured without illustration or mention of the process. And sometimes, without mention of even the manufacturing. Increasingly, items just show up in the story without fanfare. That type of granularity is no longer sensible at this stage.

Or should I say, why do you feel such rapportmanteau?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nDo I? I guess it seems that way.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, if you make up a whole lot of nonsense, you have to make up names for everything. Portmanteaus are one route I take, like echeladder, sylladex, kernelsprite, kismesis, incipisphere, etc. Some are a really obvious slamming together of two recognizable words, some are a little more obscure, jumbling together simpler morphemes, or more basic roots of language. And when you think about it, there aren't really many other ways to come up with names for stuff than combining the atomic elements of language.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother route to take which is more straightforward is just using a simple existing word to name a concept, and I do that pretty often too. Grist, denizens, underlings, consorts, the veil, the furthest ring, and the names of all the planets, which are about as simple as it gets.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, you can just make up your own nonsense words, which is an idea that's a little unpalatable to me for this project. I think that's a bit of a slippery slope to full blown fictional language building, which to me seems anchored to a much more severe kind of universe building endeavor than I wish to engage in.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe closest things to nonsense words might be names like Skaia, Derse, and Prospit, but even those are more like veiled portmanteaus. Skaia pretty obviously is sky+gaia, Derse you could view as an amalgam of dearth (scarcity) and terse (curt, abrupt, a word that could characterize someone like Jack), and Prospit is obviously prosperity and whatever myriad of words the suffix \"it\" might invoke. Perhaps esprit, which is a word in the mix of the matesprit portmanteau. So really this is just another way of saying that things in fiction that sound like nonsense are often portmanteaus in disguise.<br/>\n<br/>\nTroll names also sound like nonsense, but A) they were reader suggested and B) most of them have roots in other languages, usually pertaining to astrology. Of course since I was the one who selected the suggestions, my aversion to pure nonsense for this project had something to do with this outcome.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 13, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

IT KEEPS HAPPENING.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nOh hey you rephrased the question you just asked.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is an exploration of those things, like post death consciousness (or more commonly, the afterlife), but a lesser exploration. Elements serving as more of a backdrop for characterization, things the kids have to think about and deal with.<br/>\n<br/>\nDream selves in Homestuck are sort of a lot of things at once. It embodies some degree of awakening myth. A \"truer\" self to get in touch with and realize by overcoming something. It is also in a way the afterlife, if the correct measures are taken. It also provides a deeper and more mystical mechanism for the classic extra life in a video game. It is a means for a player to glimpse greater purpose and destiny, as well as the future. And it is even more things than this, which have not yet been developed or revealed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther post-death themes are explored but mean different things in different cases. The sprites have more to do with resurrection than a study of afterlife issues. It's application here centers around providing players with guides, elders before them who are wiser, or in various ways more knowledgeable. In a classic sense, a grandmother has such wisdom. Less conventionally, a battle hardened future self does as well. A loyal, long dead cat may as well, in the tradition of an animal totem. Death is what separates an elder from an ancestor. Extrapolating, the game provides a means for its players to tap ancestral wisdom for guidance. And though this may be the intent, obviously it can be exploited in a wide variety of ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nResurrection as a theme on the microscopic level is in play with the sprites. Macroscopically, it's invoked through the reseeding a dead civilization from the dust, as the exiles are charged with. And in a sense, with the creation of a new universe as well, wherein the players are able to resurrect their extinct race.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 16, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

But there's a difference between high content output and rapid story progression. Content output can consist of fleshing out details, silly gags, and characters shooting the breeze, which while advancing them as characters, doesn't always do a whole lot to advance the plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nStory progression tends to involve the most dirty work. It involves various conceptual upheavals, lots of new drawing, and care put into selling those developments dramatically, or in whatever other ways are important. Practically speaking, stuff can get bottlenecked behind those developments while we wait for the creator (me) to be ready to present them. The most obvious manifestation of this is with Flash animations. I can't do them at the drop of a hat (well, not always). Things get a little spread out while I prepare for such events, and some of that preparation is just psychological. There are stretches where I'd rather just relax and draw \"normal\" pages, and I use those periods to set the stage for more major impending developments, arranging the pieces and often accumulating new details as a side effect. There is a very practical ebb and flow to all this, and the consequence is a story that probably seems more drawn out than it needs to be at times.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's fine, because part of the point is to make something that is fun to read, given any local slice of it you sample. The meandering journey was part of its makeup from the start, by design. As a vehicle of compelling story delivery, by no means was this ever supposed to be an efficient, well oiled machine.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 19, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Or are there just too many?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nI think all the best movies I've seen too many times. Like Back to the Future. It's like watching wallpaper now. Nothing registers. So they don't really spring to mind as BEST MOVIE EVERSSSS.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe last two movies I saw in a theater were Scott Pilgrim, and before that, Inception. Both were good. I wish I could say great, because I really wanted them to be great. But weirdly, they both suffered from the same problem. I thought they both tried to jam too much stuff into too little time. Especially Inception. Like, times a thousand.<br/>\n<br/>\nInception was perpetually educating you on the premise. It was literally doing this until it ended. It's too bad, because it was full of fantastic concepts. Would have made a good TV show, to spread all that out and give it the exploration it needed. Only if done well though. Like the new show Walking Dead, which is taking a very cinematic concept, and spreading it into a series so it can take its time with everything, and I think it's great so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nI love convoluted ideas, but they need the space to be sold properly. This is why HS is almost 3000 pages right now. But especially for movies I think, that breathing room is essential. You need to spend time with the characters and feel who they are. I remember NOTHING about the characters from Inception, except that I guess Leo Dicaprio was soldiering around in another film with a big cross on his back, and bags under his eyes. The dude sure is sportin' some anguish these days! His plight was mostly invisible to me, because I was focused on solving The Premise Riddle, and also maybe it just wasn't all that strong when it came down to it. The whole haunted by the dead wife thing. There was Ellen Page who played the role of some sort of prodigy who could make buildings fold over on themselves, and then became someone you didn't give a shit about for the rest of the movie. Because there was NO TIME to. We needed the investment time. You can't pull giving a shit out of thin air.<br/>\n<br/>\nActually the best part of that movie was probably her whole building warping scene, with the suspenseful moment that followed where the dream crowd began catching wise to her presence, and then killed her. That's what the movie should have been, I think. Focusing more on the mind thriller aspect, playing up the Hitchcockian moments, instead of the dreadfully generic, watered down Matrix-style action scenes. When they started up with the James Bond style skis and snow mobile chase, I literally said out loud \"are you serious?\" The zero-threat NPC shoot-em-up action scenes were the worst part of the movie by far.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd weirdly, I thought the action scenes in Pilgrim were the best parts by far!!! That really surprised me. The fight scenes were incredibly cool, and felt very cinematically original. The rest, as I said, felt like too much all at once. Felt rushed, crammed, a taaad gimmicky, and somehow squeezed the charm out of the story that was present in the books. In the books you got to spend time with the characters, and the pace was your reading leisure. It was fun. In the movie you blistered through the plot points while silly Zelda noises crept out of the woodwork to remind us all how much we all like old video games. I know it probably sounds insane for a story about battling 7 evil X's, but I would have axed at least a couple X's to spread it out. Yeah, it's heresy, but Scott Pilgrim isn't a religion, it's a story, and a story has to be delivered effectively in the medium given.<br/>\n<br/>\nI guess, though you wouldn't expect it, I have purist sensibilities when it comes to film. This is why I say I would so heavily slash HS, to the point of vandalization, in adapting it to film. Film needs SPACE and TIMING to be an effective experience. So I would adapt the story to accommodate the purest FILM EXPERIENCE. Please note that as HS now stands, it is accommodating what I regard as the purest INTERNET EXPERIENCE. Something of a media freeforall, heavily user-engaging and unpredictable. But I like traditional components in cinema that have already been charted thoroughly by great filmmakers. Look at the space and timing in the Coen brothers' movies. Lots of attention given to individual scenes, isolation of moment and atmosphere, examination of character. No Country for Old Men took a very off-beat story and presented it extremely well through those methods. David Lynch also did that well, though I guess his movies were just a bit too wacky for my tastes. They were still well made though. Which isn't to say you have to duplicate these filmmaking styles to be successful in my view. Nolan, who did Inception, also did The Prestige, which was fantastically executed. It did everything I was talking about the right way to deliver what Inception attempted to, a truly diabolical story (though still basically simpler). Prestige was an A+ to Inception's C.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at that.<br/>\n<br/>\nMovie reviews.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 19, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

It was a popular theory for a long time, and one that picked up steam as evidence gathered for it. From a certain perspective, it was \"obvious\", and will especially seem so in retrospect, through rereading.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sometimes the most obvious thing is also going to be the most awesome thing, and there's just no way around that. And sometimes, ironically, the obvious thing happening can seem a bit shocking because of its obviousness.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis outcome was planned for a good while, maybe for about a year actually. And since then, I've laid the groundwork of clues and story logic that points to it. But after a while, it became clear that it would be a very guessable scenario in terms of what could happen purely from the standpoint of stakes-raising. So as I got closer to the reveal, I dropped a lot of goofy red herrings and engaged in silly forms of misdirection, to the point where it became sort of a gag unto itself. So while many may have theorized this outcome, by the time we were on its precipice, we were up to our necks in so much bullshit, I don't think anyone could be 100% confident about it, even if they still maintained the hunch.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe fact that Jack was the demon in the troll session was another \"managed guessable\". Lord English served as the red herring villain in that session to deter speculation to this effect. English was described as an indestructible demon. The trolls also described their adversary this way (though note, this is a perfectly understandable way to describe Jack in this form, especially since they didn't yet realize it was Jack). The obvious conclusion was that the trolls were dealing with English, and this is what most people guessed. In fact, this appears to have been sold so well, that some people have taken Bec Noir's entry into the troll session as proof positive that Jack = English!<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is not to say that he definitely isn't. But there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in this flash which constitutes proof that Jack is English. Lord English is an indestructible demon (who also wears a very large coat many sizes too big for Jack). Jack is also an indestructible demon. Nothing yet confirms they are the same demon.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are clues that point to Bec Noir as the trolls' adversary as well. In Alterniabound (Karkat: Wake up.) Karkat has a hunch he knows who the demon is, but doesn't want to jump to conclusions yet. He'd just seen the demon in a dream, which we just saw in the Flash. There he notices the resemblance to Jack Noir, which he hadn't noticed in the first encounter. Karkat tells Terezi that if he's right, they both get to tell each other \"I told you so.\" What he means by that is, Terezi gets to say she was right all along about Jack being bad news. Karkat gets to say he was right about it being a bad idea to exile Jack (because at the time, it's quite understandable for Karkat to presume it was the same Jack he met, rather than one from a different session.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were a few people out there who theorized both these things in tandem (Bec prototyping, Jack = demon). But that's what happens when you leave clues lying around. Someone out there will guess right. But if you don't leave the clues, developments have no plot foundation. The solution is to misdirect as well as you can, in a way that's entertaining. Red herrings abound.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you go back and reread everything, especially parts of the troll arc, and the troll/kid logs, you see tons of clues pointing to all this, and very careful language about the demon, what the kids did wrong, etc, to conceal what would eventually happen, while not contradicting it. But in totality, it all added up to this.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 27, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

This is just before the scratch, as indicated on the Trollian timeline.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe know that the kids have around 24 hours between this future moment, and the start of the reckoning. Jade's entry was not too long after the start of the reckoning, perhaps several hours. It could be in the neighborhood of 20 hours after Jade's entry when the scratch happens.

That's adding insult to injury.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nThe entry items for the trolls is one of those topics that was left to the imagination, and it's likely this will always remain the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nEntry items as a whole were never supposed to be THAT significant as a game detail, but in looking back on the four items we've seen, there's a lot to talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach one is symbolic in some sense of a departure. And each has things in common with some of the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn's is the simplest, and rooted in the most obvious myth, which is taking a bite of an apple from the tree of knowledge. It makes sense for a number of reasons. It represents the most significant departure since it kicks off the whole game. It's also very easy to \"solve\". There's no puzzle element to it. They get progressively more complicated.<br/>\n<br/>\nRose had to break a wine bottle on her house, just as ships are christened. And though not seemingly a part of the challenge at first, the trial involved losing the bottle and having to take a leap of faith to retrieve it, and well as rely on a friend (Jaspersprite) to help her complete the trial. This was required of Jade as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nDave had to wait for an egg to hatch. The symbolism of the egg, like the apple, is pretty obvious. The challenge here was to do nothing, to have patience for several hours and wait for it to hatch. And though it seems like a simple challenge, it proved difficult for Dave, and would be a significant trial for one who was to become the Knight of Time.<br/>\n<br/>\nJade had to destroy a Bec piñata. There's plenty that could be said about piñatas. You could even be as superficial as noting they're used during birthday parties, and opened to celebrate birth. But I think it's more interesting to study it from the vantage of the symbolism surrounding the destruction of effigies, and the implications this has for the Bec prototyping and Jack assuming his powers. Her challenge was to destroy it while blindfolded, and only by shooting it in the head. Several previous chat references had been made to this outcome, which was similarly foreshadowed by their strife dance together. The symbolism of killing her dangerous dog to enter (i.e. a step toward growing up) borrows notes from the Old Yeller story, but in this case, it's a dog that can't die (though nevertheless would assume a death-like state through prototyping). Also included in her challenge was taking a shot in the dark (much like Rose's leap of faith) and relying on her friend who redirected the bullet through his own head, the very friend she was attempting to slay in effigy.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is easily the most complicated of the entry puzzles, very thick with symbolic meaning, and is probably my favorite part of this animation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso note all of the items are, in a way, edible. The boys have directly edible objects, apple and egg. The girls have objects which contain edible goods; the bottle and piñata contain wine and candy, and both needed to be broken. Dave's was actually a little of both, a food product, and a container for that product which needed to be broken (i.e. hatched). John and Jade's items both came suspended from a tree. Each item had significance to the player, if loosely. Jade's was obviously quite personal. Rose's related to her mother's drinking. Dave had been plagued by crows. John's is the only one which seemed generic, although there was a tree outside his window which seemed to be a fixture of his life. His wasn't especially personal since it was the simplest trial, and something most generically befitting of entry and mythological departure.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach trial can be summarized more simply:<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn: Loss of innocence.<br/>\nRose: Leap of faith, trust in a friend.<br/>\nDave: A lesson in patience.<br/>\nJade: Shot in the dark, killing a friend for its own good, and greater good.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, and this was one of those unplanned things which I noticed:<br/>\n<br/>\nA - Apple<br/>\nB - Bottle<br/>\nC - Crow's egg<br/>\nD - Dog piñata\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nNov 28, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

The fact that I think Vriska is great has absolutely NO bearing on this.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nThat's cool, thanks. I probably am getting a lot of \"WHAT'S UP WITH VRISKA????\" questions. I haven't even scrolled down to look, so I'll just answer this one in a general way.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen examining The Case of Vriska Serket, it helps to zoom way out on the story for a moment. Rewind all the way back to act 4, when just a few trolls were lurking around, and behaving as little more than a nuisance.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I was about to launch into the Hivebent arc, I thought one cool opportunity that presented was to introduce a very major character out of nowhere, who we had literally no foreknowledge of other than one shot of a strange looking horn cropped off panel. The entire profile of this character was always meant to be \"someone who is in some way involved with practically everything\", and the scorpio sign seemed suited to this. This aspect of her profile was conveyed up front in her introduction, and hammered repeatedly with almost every scene she's been in. Hivebent was a good introduction to the ways in which she entangles herself nefariously with everything, and slowly but surely, this has been revealed to be the case in the main plotline. It was unclear before, and indeed unclear that this was even a question that needed to be answered, because she had not been introduced yet. And personally, I think there's something kind of exciting which that proposition injects into a story.<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore Hivebent, most of the trolls were portrayed as incompetent at trolling. And when the roster was expanded, the question was begged: are any of these trolls any good at trolling? So part of her profile was also to serve as the ultimate troll. Karkat was an effective troll insofar as he was loud and angry and obnoxious, but that's about as far as it went. Vriska was designed to be a good troll in the purest sense of the word. She gets people legitimately riled up. Both in the story, and even more importantly, outside it. There is no other troll, or really even any other aspect of Homestuck, which generates more debate. This was intentional, and continues to be.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if over time it begins to seem she's behind more and more of the negative plot developments, she could certainly start to be regarded by some as a one trick pony, from a plot-impact standpoint. But there's a lot to consider here. First of all, very simply, sometimes a story is going to have that \"evil mastermind\" character, who by definition is responsible for things to an extent far beyond what first appeared. This I think is a generalized enough concept to qualify as a basic story building block to adapt in creative ways, and is not so specific as to encroach on cliche territory. The mastermind is a sort of archetype, and she's revealed to be one such instantiation, with her own style and set of motives.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditionally, everything she's done is just logical with respect to everything we know about her. She is presented with a room full of computers tapped into the session which unleashed their nemesis on them. She has 6 hours to do whatever she wants. Given everything she's done before, the thought that she wouldn't use her time to maximize her influence on that session in every way she can imagine, and every way which suits her megalomaniacal point of view, is pretty implausible. Of course she's going to secretively wreak havoc. We are just systematically discovering how she went about it. This was an ENORMOUS question begged by the Hivebent arc, considering her relevance there. Which was, now that we know about her, what was Vriska's role in the kids' session? This is a really striking point of curiosity, especially since we had never heard a peep out of her before Hivebent. It turns out, surprise surprise, that she had more influence than even the \"main troll\". The difference was, while he was very loud and stormed through the front gate (backwards), she kept a low profile and was more devious. And if we somehow discovered this WASN'T the case, it would actually strike me as a pretty bizarre development with no real meaning or purpose.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd going back to the point about \"zooming out of the story\" for a moment, when judging these things it helps to examine the difference between reading this serially vs. archivally. These are extremely different ways to read a story, and radically affect your perception of developments. Reading all of act 5 might take a few hours, but doing so live takes months, along with which comes a lot of intense scrutiny and speculation. So while you're reading live and it turns out Vriska's responsible for more shenanigans, the reaction can easily turn into \"oh here we go again with this\", because you're absorbing it in slow motion. Her antics become sort of codified in the rolling serial myth of the story. Whereas reading in one shot, I think all this comes across as more of a reasonably paced revelation of exactly what's going on, in a way that makes sense and ties stuff together. If you just read the story starting today, you didn't even know who Vriska was until a few hours ago!<br/>\n<br/>\nIn act 4, there was a lot of intrigue built up. And a secret question could have been asked. What if there was an unseen mastermind behind a lot of this? How did that happen, and why? And what if we find out all the answers in the next act, in ways we were never imagining? If you were to entertain such questions at the time, I think it makes for an exciting revelatory process. We are in the thick of that process now, albeit in slow motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this doesn't mean we should take her at her word when she says she's behind \"everything\". That's obviously how she would view it of course. But to take that literally would be to underestimate the complexity of what's going on. There's a lot happening, and really she's just another cog, even if it's a major one.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe gets a lot of screen time because she's a major character now, and as I said, that was in fact built into her profile before I even drew her. If you're wondering why we camp on her when there are so many other nice trolls to dwell on, well, sorry. There are major characters, and there are minor ones. If you're waiting for me to fire up NEPETAQUEST 2011, don't hold your breath.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 12, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Maybe one good way to define a main villain is whether stopping him will allow the heroes to overcome all their major obstacles.

If anyone's a \"Parody Sue\", which is already an entry in TV tropes, it would have been Jade in the early going. But even then, I don't think I'd really call her that. I think it's a little lame to be aware of tropes while writing a story and almost use them as a palette, or a checklist. Like, ok, I'm gonna do that and that and that! I just saw her as cute, silly character with lots of answers at that point in the story with SOME traces of satire directed at \"Sue types\", who eventually had the rug of all her advantages pulled out from under her and now has to go through a process of discovery like the others. Not every peg needs to be crammed into some trope hole, even if it seems vaguely apropos.<br/>\n<br/>\nVriska, if anything, would be a further distortion of a Parody Sue, like an \"Evil Parody Sue\", and even then, in a kind of meta way. She lives her life as her own self-aggrandizing, wildly powerful self-insert character, always comes out on top, and never suffers consequences. She even sort of mocks her own intent on this on a meta level by \"self-inserting\" into the kids' story and influencing their events, as she said. And when I say \"she mocks\" I guess I mean \"I mock\". I'm usually pretty aware of a lot of tropes even though I've made nothing close to an exhaustive study of tvtropes.com, and I'm much more inclined to include tropes by warping them rather than deliberately decorating the story with a lot of straightup instances. Though obviously using them is often inevitable, since these are atomic storytelling building blocks we're talking about here.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 12, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

We had a girl who fell asleep a lot, inexplicably. We had an evil troll who liked to put kids to sleep as her primary means of influence. HMMMMM.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Dave's death, her involvement was actually reasonably foreshadowed. We knew Vriska was responsible for killing Dave at least once, according to Karkat, per her feud with Terezi. Now we know how. Could it have been foreshadowed MORE SO before Hivebent? Maybe... but how, and why? All we knew was DD went to Dave's place to get the journal, in the exact window of time it was on the toilet. How did he know it was there? Some mysterious \"anonymous tip\" I guess. Now we know the nature of that tip. I'm struggling to think of a way in which additional foreshadowing would have actually improved this event.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, her being \"behind everything\" was a statement made by her, an exhibit of bravado. We have no evidence regarding what else she's influenced.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut yeah, looking at those examples you're totally right.

Maybe looked back at something you did a year ago and gone \"ah, crap, I wish I'd done that differently\"? Not that I'm saying you should -- everything's real cool\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nWhile simultaneously realizing that everything I do can always be better in every single way, regrets and rear view gazing are excluded from the process deliberately. This is storytelling in hyperspace. Everything is done with the intent to make something as good as it can be, as loose as can be, and as FAST. FAST. FAST. as possible. Lamenting decisions is at odds with this approach, and would be irrational. If I allowed room for second guessing, then I'd be doing something completely different.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can isolate any single thing from this, written or drawn, and conclude that with a little more time, some more drafting, editing and revision, it would improve. Such are the benefits that more conventional productions enjoy. They are how works of entertainment become polished. But that's not the mission here. There is virtually no editing going on here at all, at any stage, from conception, to typing, to drawing, to animating, to posting. The most written editing I'll do is tweaking a phrase or two after copy-pasting the text from the doc into the browser while updating. Drawings are never drafted or revised. It's always done in one shot. I don't storyboard the animations, and often don't really have the full scene sequence in mind until I'm nearly done. It's very fluid. It's all part of the challenge this represents to me in totality, and an aspect of its experimental nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nCould it reach another level with a more intensive editing process (or one at all)? Of course. With enough concentrated reexamination, I'm sure the thing could be smoothed to such a seamless literary state, it could enter Earth's atmosphere without catching fire. It could certainly be more illustratively maniacal too. But editing is a time sink. Even a little is too much, because the top priority by far is speed. To bring as many ideas to coherent realization as quickly as possible. I get the most out of visuals with the least effort, and even though it doesn't look like I'm using all my artistic ability to make this, I do use my full experience as an artist to understand how best to optimize. Strong, simple shapes and silhouettes, dynamic composition, attention to color choice, minimal splashes of animation, all those things go a really long way for making striking visuals without requiring much effort.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt just occurred to me recently that I haven't even reread the whole story in more than a year. (It's too long! Who has time for that.) There was a time in the early going, when it was a couple hundred pages, I'd reread it now and then to develop a feel for how it read, and help solidify my thoughts on the new project and develop ideas for where I wanted to push it in its fledgling state. But after rolling for a while, rereads became unnecessary. I maintain all relevant story data in a part of my mind which I'm sure has adapted itself to be completely useless for any other task besides keeping track of Homestuck. (Though I will say, mingling amidst community discussion does help keep some details fresh in the mind.) The only time I go back to an earlier page is to verify a particular phrasing or such, or to check out a panel as a drawing reference. Other than that, I'm not sure if I've reread more than 10 consecutive pages in a year. That would be rear view gazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut having said that...<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe I'll give it a full reread in the near future, just for the hell of it.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 17, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

These wounds are healed upon resurrection.<br/>\n<br/>\nPresumably the dream self will eventually die from the same wounds inflicted on the real self, but after a time delay.

We do not see his activity very often because it is TOO HOT FOR THE WEB.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe doesn't do much in the story because he is a supporting character.

Sure he would be a stronger and more interesting character if he had the screen time to allow it. But we must imagine this SHADOW PLOT wherein he occupies this time and does interesting things, and all the existing pages and action which that must necessarily be crowded out in favor of developing him that way. Is it worth it? Maybe, if you are a huge Sollux fan. But in this dimension, that is not the role he plays in an otherwise very busy story, and that's just how it is.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 28, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Feferi was dreaming of the Furthest Ring then + Eridan's compy wasn't intact.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nSee notes a couple questions down.<br/>\n<br/>\nPinning some of these key events to a concrete timestamped schedule has sort of opened a can of worms, which I deliberately springloaded into the can and fired into my own face. I guess I am inviting the challenge for myself to make all this hazy troll timetable stuff more definite?<br/>\n<br/>\nBefore I could always decide that a troll could do something or talk to someone, and there would always be a built in fudge factor dictating when it actually happened. And that worked pretty well. I built up quite a lot of events and conversational itineraries that way. But now that it's all out there, I guess it's kind of a personal challenge to see if I can make a little more sense of it (without being excruciatingly rigorous that is).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo now we have some key times on a countdown to zero, which we can place some critical events on.<br/>\n<br/>\n10:25:00 - Jack arrives in troll session. Trolls escape to veil, spend about 4 hours messing around doing who knows what.<br/>\n<br/>\nMinutes before time below: Tavros gets legs sawed off, Karkat faints.<br/>\n<br/>\n06:12:00 - Prospit is destroyed. Dream Karkat etc are killed.<br/>\n<br/>\nShortly after that, Terezi smells explosion, goes downstairs, discovers money transfer from Dave. Thus learns about humans. She and other trolls (notably Vriska) get a head start on messing with kids while Karkat sleeps,<br/>\n<br/>\n05:12:30 - One hour later, exactly halfway through countdown, Karkat wakes up, learns about humans, begins campaign of trolling.<br/>\n<br/>\n04:13:00 - Jack destroys Derse. Eridan's computer and Aradia blow up. Feferi stays asleep while dream-dead, shares dream bubble with Jade. Later wakes up, talks to Jade about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nKnowing this basic structure, we can fill in a lot of events around this loosely, between and after the key points. For instance, at 4:13, it seems Vriska and Tavros have not left the room yet for their confrontation. Eridan has yet to get his wand. And so on.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also know that shortly after the expiration of the countdown, Terezi has the conversation with Dave in which she told him to wire the money back to her, 6 hours and 12 minutes ago from her vantage. This suggests she has not stayed completely linear in her interaction with Dave. (Which would make sense, considering how much time traveling he's been doing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nWe also know that Karkat is around after the countdown from one of the memo timestamps.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's a big puzzle!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 29, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

We knew these things, and their patent inevitability should tip you off that these deaths were not meant to trigger what you seem to be looking for.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are many things we know in advance, and the intrigue surrounds discovering how, rather than if or what. And mixed in with this, there are many revelations not foretold as well. This seems to me to be the best way to assemble a story dealing heavily with not only time travel, but nonlinear construction.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if you care to adjust your dials to the actual emotional frequency of what is going on in a story, maybe you should consider this. Sometimes emotion is not conducted directly to the reader by a death, through a first hand sense of shock and loss, but peripherally through the other characters' reactions to that loss! Consider a biographical film of a famous person's story who is known to die tragically. Is there no room for emotion surrounding the inevitable?\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nDec 29, 2010\n\n\n</div>"

Have you ever considered that they may have been better off as asides instead of being directly in the adventure log (like the way SBAHJ just gets linked rather than getting updates to itself)?\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nNah, it's fine the way it is. You say I could take a different approach because *some* people don't like something? Oh no! Who would have thought a certain quantity of people wouldn't like something! I've got to make sure that never happens, ever, I don't know what I was thinking.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ok, 4th wall stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes I catch people wrinkling their noses at the goofy 4th wall stuff. Now, I'll roll my eyes as much as the next guy at some really inappropriate 4th wall bending in places it doesn't belong. Probably the benchmark for where it feels appropriate and complements the story is something like Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Who doesn't find it charming and hilarious whenever he lowers his shades and sasses us through the silver screen, while Cameron kicks his dads car into a forest to the score of \"BOW BOW..... chicka-chickaaaaaaaa\"? Nobody is who. But taken beyond that, in works of more serious dramatic magnitude, or just really mishandled in some types of comedy, people start groaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people are inclined to give these things more latitude. Others are more strict.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut regardless of where you are on this spectrum, I kinda have to wonder how cement headed a guy has to be not to see that if ever there was a time such antics were permissible, it would be through this particular format, and this particular story. Remember what sort of thing you're reading? Seems like I've got to remind people sometimes.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of all, let's acknowledge that regardless of how immersed you are in whatever's going on, this is a story built almost entirely out of ridiculous gags. The preceding stories were too. PS warped the 4th wall in similar ways, and this is the tradition through which HS was conceived and delivered. It's light, it's loose, and above most other considerations, humor prevails.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are even more important reasons than this. The entire nature of the story/format is one of blurriness between reader, player, author and character. It began with readers issuing commands to characters, and me the author parsing them, and the character responding with action to both parties. It is at all times a fluid dialogue taking place between these story entities. And at all times the author's presence is quite palpable, even without the actual AH avatar present. The narrator's voice is pretty unapologetically my own, and I think that's clear to the alert reader. He quips with the player and the character alike. But it goes even further than this. As the story progresses, these player/character roles become even more malleable. Characters in the story actually control OTHER characters, through the exact same text command vehicle which drives the whole narrative! The whole thing is utterly saturated with such meta qualities, and picking out the single generically unpalatable author avatar as the deal breaker in all this is pretty petty, and reeking of less than comprehensive appreciation for the themes. The story is about players and characters watching and controlling players and characters watching and controlling players and characters, in screens in screens in screens. Server player monitors client player. Exile commands session player. Trolls from one session mess with those from another. People are commanded psychically, through reader input, through the reader's keyboard arrows at times, through the narrative volition of ==&gt;, and through author mandate. People are spied on through crystal balls, fenestrated walls, Sburb windows, chat clients, future command station terminals, dreams, clouds, and finally, yes, a 4th wall through which we have access to the author, who's very presence in the story was already keenly felt REGARDLESS.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll of this considered, even if you're of the mindset of \"NEVER NEVER NEVER\" on 4th wall shenanigans, it's still beyond me how you couldn't see that if one and only one story/format combo was to get a free pass on this, it would be HS. Everything written above is quite honestly approaching the threshold of the unassailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut sticking to your guns on that stance is most definitely a safe position to take.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe, and also WRONG.<br/>\n<br/>\nSafe and wrong. Wow, what a terrible combination!<br/>\n<br/>\nI have trouble imagining how ashamed I would feel if I ever lumbered under such a grueling dichotomy.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJan 2, 2011\n\n\n</div>"

You have a great and terrible power. Take care in it's use.\n</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nThis is the power of the visual callback.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome people scratch their heads over them and wonder what's the deal. This is not actually THE deal with them, but it demonstrates something they can accomplish.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat has happened here is a secondary, hidden joke has been told in parallel with the events taking place. Because these frames are direct mods of earlier panels conveying a similar scene but a totally different situation, the reader, if alert, remembers exactly what should come next. Hence we have an \"extra\" joke in addition to all the obvious points of humor. You are caused to imagine these two are about to kiss, and that is funny and absurd.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis cannot be accomplished nearly as directly without the visual callbacks. But this does not mean every time we see such a callback, there is a similar joke being cracked. It's not quite that simple or literal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut using them frequently is important for setting them up for use in situations like this. You can't really just pull one out of a hat without establishing the tendency to do so. The callbacks have been woven into the fabric of normalcy first, to the point where they hardly raise an eyebrow anymore, while still demanding your recognition when they happen.<br/>\n<br/>\nHaving established them this way, there are other more subtle purposes they can serve as well. Not just jokes. Sometimes they illustrate contrast in situation. Like when Davesprite defended sleeping Dave, that panel was reused when future Dave stood over sleeping doomed Dave, contemplating whether to kill him. Pretty contrasting moments, and the callback invites such reflection.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with the Jadesprite callback. It wasn't just the joke being communicated. It also echoed the first time it was used, when Dream Jade slapped Dream John trying to wake him. Now situation is somewhat reversed. Dream Jade (Jadesprite) is being slapped by Real Jade. That character's role in the scenario has transmuted from heroic to pathetic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNone of this reads at all, or is put in the spotlight for consideration, without the callbacks.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJan 4, 2011\n\n\n</div>"

It's quite an elegant ballet of mutual shrugging.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, I think we should be clear on what a \"personalization\" is. It is a sketch, not a commission. A sketch is something I can do quickly, whereas a commission is not. I would love to be able to do every outlandish idea people have, and would certainly do so in smaller quantity. But when I get requests of an extremely diverse nature, often involving many characters at once, and have to do hundreds of those, that is actually somewhat mind destroying after a while. The consequence is a radical reduction in quality of the sketches.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is better I think is to do what I am doing. Which is to draw a single character, do a better job with each sketch, in a way that allows me to satisfy many people without requiring the mental gymnastics of processing hundreds of endlessly specific ideas involving 2-20 characters at once. So it's not that the price didn't drop for a lesser service... it's that the original service was underpriced!!!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJan 7, 2011\n\n\n</div>"

Ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthenticating your drawing isn't a simple matter of taking a photo of someone posing like your character, and if the photo matches up with the drawing perfectly, then everything checks out.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other things in play, such as<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Stylization<br/>\n2) Dramatization of perspective, through devices such as lensing effects<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the two are related. Dramatizing perspective contributes significantly to the parameters for stylization. And not understanding this leads to some dubious observations.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, let's look at this cat in a fish eye lens.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"/archive/social/formspring/11-Super-Wide-Angle-Digital-Camera.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.instructables.com/image/FMW0YNUX9OEP2819DD/11-Super-Wide-Angle-Digital-Camera.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nIf you converted that to a line drawing without knowledge of the lens, suddenly hopy shit that paw is huuuuuge, and way stockier and more exaggerated than could be accounted for by foreshortening. You could explain this, and there would always be someone out there who wouldn't care. They'd say, no it's huge dude. Look at it, it's huge. That paw is huge, don't even start with me.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy drawing isn't being fisheyed, but there's a similar principle in play. Perspective is accelerating in the space through which the arm extends. It's not super dramatic lensing, but its enough to offset expected foreshortening.<br/>\n<br/>\nCombine that with the anatomical stylization of the figure, which is on the lanky-limbed side to start with, and you get what's there. Don't think it looks cool? Whatever! Looks good to me, but then, I know the vantage from which it's meant to be parsed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be a shame if all art had to forfeit things like dynamism in perspective, anatomical stylization and things like that because people not familiar with these principles regard their yields as defective.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway now that all that's been explained to death I guess it kind of ruins the drawing? Kind of like an overexplained joke. But maybe we learned some stuff?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is, I think people with more knowledge on art ironically tend to be MORE permissive of certain deviations in approach, like off template anatomy or perspective, if pursued with otherwise keen fundamentals and an intelligent eye toward aesthetics. It's the people with less knowledge who pick and fuss over stuff that just isn't really the \"big problem\" they think it is, even though they think they're packing hella standards. They don't have the knowledge to fully contextualize what they're observing, and they can't properly articulate their reservations, so they often resort to exaggeration, and QUITE often carry a pretty sour demeanor about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nI call this Picky Little Bitch Syndrome.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not just art. Every field has its PLBs. Movies, books webcomics...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd calling a PLB on being a PLB only makes them grumpier, which only further cements the diagnosis. For instance, any grumpy response to what I've said here will serve as a convenient admission to PLBhood!

All we know is she and WV are sharing a dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nDream rules have never been that easy to pin down. We only know what we know about dreams and dream selves after facts have accumulated over a long period of time. WV's dream sequence doesn't seem to fit into the existing model, and we can't expect to figure out how it fits into everything right away, if it does at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt does seem the sequence was more like a \"normal\" dream, full of symbols and foreshadowed peril. Vriska, for whatever reason, deliberately or otherwise, shared this normal dream, and was able to understand some things about its context, and the role WV is supposed to play. Perhaps her psychic acuity was a factor. Perhaps her godhood status was as well. All you can do is speculate.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe do know that she is dreaming without a dream self, and without her dream self having been killed. She is her dream self, having resurrected to reach the god tier. We didn't know anything about how such a character would dream, but here's a glimpse at some evidence.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJan 10, 2011\n\n\n</div>"

Trying things out, seeing what works and what doesn't and learning from it.

As an ambassador for my work, especially in the FS format for whatever reason, I'm pretty off the rails.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhenever you're dealing with a serious artist, there is a decent chance you are dealing with someone who doesn't always care to be polished in diplomacy. I've heard that Picasso was kind of a dickhead. He probably didn't cut a whole lot of slack to someone who said, hey Pablo you stuck the eye in the wrong place, fuckass. He was a very important artist and had all these BIG IDEAS and the net result of it all was something great. Maybe his personal volatility was part of that package?<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the same time, someone would be perfectly justified, then and now, to say, hey Pablo, that painting looks like shit. I mean, some of his paintings really seriously did look like shit. And he would be equally justified in calling them PLBs for not \"getting\" it, and he probably did. He probably had his own term for those sons of bitches. He would be justified in doing so because he knew that everything he did, even the shitty stuff, was part of something bigger, even if only in his warped mind.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that said, and everything said below, maybe this is all getting a bit distracting. That is, talking about myself and my views on my work and my views on the views of others. It is possibly getting JUST A LITTLE tedious, and maybe it's time to reel in the purpose of my Formspring exploits.<br/>\n<br/>\nI mentioned a lot of stuff was getting buried. Maybe answering 1000+ poorly archived questions is getting into ridiculous territory. Maybe it's time to delete all the questions, clean the slate, and start new with a modified focus.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhatever imperceptible benefit typing this is having, I'm sure as hell not DRAWING right now, that's for sure.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">andrewhussie</span>\nresponded\n\n\nJan 10, 2011\n\n\n</div>"

Why is that? A strange form of theater I guess. Probably some people think it is unsettling, but that's because it does too good a job at rendering a great pit of hostility beneath the surface. Such is the power of having complete control over the flow of information. This is the advantage the media enjoys, and which is why they can keep a lid on important and completely true conspiracies from being known.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was kind of wondering if I went too far in any of my recent answers. Feeling mildly concerned about this, I reread everything I wrote, and I am pleased to report in the light of a new day that I have been 1000% exonerated. My FS answers remain as lucid as ever - coherent, informative, humble, and at worst, transcendentally hilarious.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if anybody was wondering, the comparison of myself with Picasso below was in fact a strikingly successful attempt to place myself on the same level as one of the greatest and most acclaimed artists who ever lived, if not significantly higher. In no way was the comparison made simply because everyone has heard of him, to make a separate point. If that were the case, ideally I would have selected a very bad and unfamous artist to maintain a pleasing veneer of humility.

Knowing this, I don't think it's a very interesting avenue\nof discussion right now. Are we to weigh the universe containment\nmerits of frogs, vs. say, bears?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe definitive answer, as of now, is that any definitive answer would be pretty\nboring.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut there are nevertheless some reasons. And more important than the\nreasons for the decision is to notice how thematically entrenched frogs\nhave been in the story for a very long time. All the mechanics of this,\nthe genesis frog and the frog breeding stuff, was conceptualized well\nbefore the end of act 2. EOA2 was when we first saw the frog ruins,\nremember? An idol of the embodiment of a universe to be created,\npositioned where Skaia would be, surrounded by four towers representing\nthe planets. There was no basis for speculation on why a frog stood in\nSkaia's place until now. This has probably been the slowest boiling\nmystery in the entire story. After a while, I think prolonged,\nrelentless exposure to certain symbols and aspects of a myth start to\nwear down the need to justify why they exist. They exist simply because\nthey exist, like the features of fables we've all heard a thousand\ntimes. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, in processing the \"why frogs\" matter, it does help to\nunderstand the mentality I have in coming up with all ideas for HS. The\nidea from the start was to come up with a very elaborate, fantastical\nand ridiculous creation myth. Some ideas are quite esoteric, some are\nquite passable for more conventional works of science fiction, and some\nare very silly. Most are a combination of these. Most of the time, the\nsilly stuff is not so outrageously silly that it can't be workable in a\nserious way too when needed. That adequately describes the concept of a\nuniverse existing inside of a large frog bred and genetically engineered\nby children, I think.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 19, 2011 - Jan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

I hardly ever come\nup with an idea directly inspired something else (unless it's something I\ndid, in which case I do it almost constantly.) But then after I have\nthe idea, I may immediately think of something that's kind of similar\nfrom another work.

The\nfirst Flash game involving the trolls was inordinately long, taking\nsomething like 30 minutes for a player to feel sure all possibilities\nhave been exhausted. But its length provided a good way to demonstrate\nthe format's capabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt set a precedent for a game of that length, but not a trend. There's\nno reason to expect they should all be. These are just individual pages\nin a story after all, and my intent for the format was always to make\nthe games about this length.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe battle at the end did mark the end of the game. There was nothing\nmore to it, and I don't think it needed to be especially explicit about\nthat. You could try mashing the spacebar during the battle or whatever,\nand observe it did nothing. The prompt at the end to restart tells you\nit's over. What else is there to suggest there's more? Aside from an\nexpectation that since it feels like a fully functional game, it should\nbehave like one rather than what is essentially a shallow simulation to\nhit a few story points.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's one of the pitfalls of mixing these types of media. While\nflipping through pages, you switch from your \"story reader's mind\" to\nyour \"game player's mind\", which expects different things. Having played\nmany games, we grow to expect fully fleshed out, complete gaming\nexperiences from whatever we play, even if not consciously. These little\nin-story fragments can leave us a little puzzled, because they are\nincomplete, and the instinctive game player in us finds that a little\nfrustrating. But I view this as a good thing, and wouldn't seek to\nimprove it. The clash between those two mindsets of media consumption\ndemonstrates we're engaging with something unique. It's not an\nexperience you have with other forms of entertainment.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 22, 2011 - Jan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

For the reader especially, I\nthink the experience of day to day reading is so dramatically different,\nthey might as well be reading a different story altogether. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe main difference is the amount of space between events the reader\nhas, which can be filled with massive amounts of speculation, analysis,\npredictions, and something I guess you could call \"opinion building\",\nwhich can have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side,\nthese readers become more closely engaged with the material than\narchival readers can be, zeroing in on details and insights which might\nbe overlooked otherwise. On the negative side, I think that excess\nmental noise the space between pages allows can potentially be a bit\nsuffocating, and put a strain on the experience the material was\nintended to deliver.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe archival reader always has the luxury of moving on to the next page,\nregardless of how he reacts to certain events, and thus can be more\nimpassive about it. That internal cacophony isn't given time to build,\nand if there are reservations about a string of events, whether due to\nshocking revelations, or questions over the narrative merit of\nsomething, or really any form of dissatisfaction, all he has to do is\nkeep clicking to see how it all fits together, and can make a more\ncomplete judgment with hindsight.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe recent pages had me particularly conscious of the nature of serial\ndelivery. The whole scene was rolled out over the course of a weekend,\nfirst with Feferi, then Kanaya. When Fereri dies, this registers as one\nextremely dramatic event. Cue the waiting, speculating, worrying and all\nthat. When Kanaya dies a day or so later, it registers as a second\ndramatic event! Again the scrutiny begins which the space allows. Is\nthis all too much? How do I feel about this narrative turn? Is this\nsetting a trend for a bloodbath? Does that serve any purpose? The reader\nprojects into the future, does a little unwitting fanfiction writing in\nhis head, and may not like what he sees! All this activity becomes the\nbasis for opinion building, which is sort of the emergence of an\nofficial position on matters, good or bad, which is only able to\nflourish in the slow-motion intake of the story. That official position\ncan be a very stubborn thing, especially when it's negative, and\nseriously textures the way additional developments are regarded. It's\nreally hard to shake a reader off an entrenched position on a matter,\neven when it was formed with an incomplete picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nReading the same events in the archive is quite different. Very little\nof that inner monologue takes shape. And while the events are still\nshocking, and the reader may raise his eyebrows a mile high, he then\nsimply lowers them and keeps reading. In fact, because of the reading\npace, I would suggest these two deaths actually register as only ONE\nDRAMATIC EVENT! One guy snaps and kills two characters. In the flow of\nstraight-through reading especially, it is quite startling,\ntension-building, and can only serve to propel the reader into further\npages, at a pace which suspends the experience-compromising\n(augmenting??) play-by-play.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut like I've said, I don't think one way of reading is necessarily\nbetter than the other. Both have plusses, and obviously I choose to make\nthis serially, and I play off plenty of in the moment reactions. But I\ntend consider the archival experience more, because when all is said and\ndone, this thing has to sit on a server for years to come, waiting for\nnew people to find it.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 23, 2011 - Jan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

These people are\nfreaking out! Sign of a good story, for sure.</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nPeople tend to be pretty emotional creatures and I know that\nsome people shed tears over much lesser turns in a story than this.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo knowing that, I guess there is something a little weird about pulling\nthe trigger on an event which I know perfectly well will cause plenty\nof people to cry ACTUAL TEARS, most of which are probably perfectly nice\nteenage girls who I have no business affecting in this way at all. To\nthose people I guess I'll have to offer a real apology, because I'm not\nactually out to ruin anyone's day.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut when you're making a story with any sort of dramatic clout, even a\nlargely humorous one, I don't think it pays to be gutless. Both in terms\nof reader reaction, fear of sparking sadness, anger, or bad reviews,\nand in terms of being overly precious with your characters and ideas, to\nthe point where it becomes obvious you're unwilling to mess with\nanything or put anyone important in real danger, which does a lot to\nkill suspense. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's actually a pretty common way to construct a story, to the\npoint where we are all extremely used to watching stuff where heroes\nare in no real peril, and because it's so common we can accept and enjoy\nit. This also makes it more shocking and emotional when a story steps\noutside of that comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's only emotional if people are invested in those threatened. This\nis one reason why a lot of horror movies can be so ineffective, grisly\nmoments notwithstanding. Rosters are knowingly introduced for the\nslaughter, with only lip service given to investment in characters. And\neven if approached skillfully, there isn't even much time to win the\nhearts and minds of the audience for the full cast.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut this is a little different. We've spent a lot of time with these\ncharacters. And if the threat to their lives seems like a sudden\ndirection, I'd suggest that doing it earlier or more gradually wouldn't\nhave allowed it to mean the same thing.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 23, 2011 - Jan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

But Kanaya was\nthe one that hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nSad things happen in stories. Even funny ones!<br/>\n<br/>\nProbably the most memorable episode of Futurama for me was the one where\nhis dog waits for him on the street corner for years, until it dies.\nAnd then? THE END.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat was awful! I don't know anyone who ever watched that episode who\nwasn't emotionally crushed by that ending. Almost to the point where it\nwas unbelievable they made such a thing happen. I was not alone in\nspeaking to the TV: \"Futurama, what are you doing to me? FUTURAMA???\nYou're not supposed to do this, you're FUNNY!!!\"<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yet, that episode was great! Even the ending was great, all things\nconsidered. In retrospect its very gesture was sort of darkly hilarious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not exactly comparing this character death with that moment, but\njust pointing it out as an example of a piece of entertainment which I\nbelieve successfully blended emotional tones. That's what's been going\non with HS for quite some time.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, Futurama always struck me as a really good example of something\nthat did that, and I can think of very few other examples. Futurama was\nperpetually hilarious, while doing a pretty great job of making you\ncare about the characters and what happened to them. It actually\nsuccessfully pulled off a lot of poignant moments, not just dog\nkillings. I'm trying to think of of other comparably humorous pieces of\nentertainment that worked a serious side well and not thinking of much.\nThe Simpsons, not quite. Certainly nothing of Family Guy's ilk. (ok I'm\nreally just thinking of TV shows now) Arrested Development could be a\ngood example. Certainly off the charts in hilarity and characterization,\nthough in hindsight I don't think it ever laid the drama on all that\nthick. It usually played its serious notes to set up gags, and often\nshortchanged drama by making continuity itself a gag (NEXT TIME ON\nARRESTED DEVELOPMENT: jokes jokes jokes)<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I had to grope for another example, I might reach back years and\nyears to something called Red Dwarf. Which was a British scifi comedy tv\nshow. But not the show, the book! The novelization of it was my first\nexposure to it, and when I was a teenager I remember thinking it was the\nfunniest, greatest shit ever. It might have been my teen goggles\ntinting it though, I really don't know how it would hold up for me now. I\ndidn't even know it was based on a show, and later when I saw it, I\nthought it was good, but not as great unsurprisingly. Oddly, the concept\nwas essentially the same as Futurama. A guy is frozen in stasis for a\nlong time, wakes up in the future. But he's the last guy alive, a la\nHitchhiker's Guide. I always liked this way better than Hitchhiker's\nthough for some reason, which I was never as gaga over as so many seem\nto be. This story struck me as not only funnier, but more heartfelt, and\nreally captured the essence of the lonely journey of the last human\nalive, alone in a giant space ship with his idiot hologram friend.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking back on it, I'm probably weirdly influenced by that series in ways I'm\nprobably not even aware of.<br/>\n<br/>\nEND RAMBLE\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 23, 2011 - Jan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

So yeah, this was always a strong\npossibility, without necessarily being 100% committed to it the whole\ntime. Regardless, there was some groundwork set up for that possibility\nshould I decide to run with it, which I did, and the decision was made\nquite some time ago.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame with others we've seen recently. Kanaya had the theme of virginity\ndue to her sign, which when you think about it, is a pretty TOUGH\nCONCEPT to shape into coherence for a character in an ensemble like\nthis, but I worked it by bonding her to matriarchal themes with her\nvirgin mother grub lusus, and the role she inherited as progenitor and\ncaretaker of the matriorb, and more specifically, recently showing the\nfutility of that role, as the concept of chastity is not particularly\ncompatible with successful breeding. When she found the key to release\nit, it was a sign that all along it was not meant to be used, but\ndestroyed.<br/>\n<br/>\nEridan was originally cast as someone dangerous and genocidal, but those\nqualities were never illustrated and became easily dismissed as a joke\nas his whole character seemed to revolve around failed romantic\naspirations for so long. But they came back, reminding us they were\ndriving forces behind his profile. (His name, caligulasAquarium, was\nalso tied to his various romantic obsessions, particularly the need for a\nrival, which is bound to the caliginous quadrant, another word for\ndark.) Ultimately his dreams of genocide were realized by being the one\nto destroy the orb, which appeared to always be his intent for \"helping\nher\" with it, making his preceding conversation with Kanaya much more\ndetestably villainous than it seemed. In doing so, he destroyed hope for\nthe species. This is his final interpretation of his role as the Prince\nof Hope. Not as one who fights for hope, but destroys it. He's\ncertainly the worst kind of bastard this story has to offer.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoth Eridan's and Gamzee's dangerous sides were heavily masked by the\nlong adherence to their roles as one note gag characters, and made it\nvery difficult to predict these outcomes seriously. A few days ago,\nnobody at all is guessing Eridan walks into a room and kills two\ncharacters. And before this page:<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/mspa/005119\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=005119</a><br/>\n<br/>\nEven fewer people would ever make a serious guess Gamzee would become a threat.\nCommitment to the gag was too air tight.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's was makes the development equal parts disturbing and funny in my view.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJan 24, 2011\n\n</div>"

Practically nobody\never guesses stuff I seriously don't want them to guess. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther times I leave more obvious bread crumbs to let certain outcomes be\nmore guessable to the public. With the whole Kanpire thing I think I\nwas pretty much beating people over the head with foreshadowed elements,\nincluding a brazen link to a SBaHJ comic in which Jeff appeared as a\nvampire directly below the scene of her demise. Hence her resurrection\ncould safely be conducted to a chorus of NO SHIT!s with a few smug\nCALLED IT!s chiming in for backup, oh and also some HELL YEAH VAMPNAYA\nTIME!s working their way in there. This is not to say the outcome was a\nlock, because there is always the possibility for red herrings, and\nenough of those have been established so that you can never feel\ncompletely safe with a prediction. That is their primary value.\nSeriously, it isn't just messing with people. Making a story\nunpredictable has a lot to do with showing you are capable of doing\npractically anything at any time. Sometimes you bluff, and sometimes you\nplay it straight. It's a little like a poker game. If you do too much\nof one or the other, people can read you easily. Even the silly self\ninsert stuff has benefits in this regard. Predicting what's to come in\nthe story is no different from putting yourself in the head of the\nauthor. If the author paints a portrait of himself as kind of a loose\ncanon, either through a volatile narrative, or in an absurdly literal\nway as I do with the AH nonsense, that will be the consequence. <br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the fun of a story is its unpredictability, and this one has had\nplenty of it so far I think. Unpredictability is a significant basis\nfor suspense, and I'm sure has other benefits we could examine. But I\nthink there is also enjoyment value in occasional predictability, or\nrather, guessability. Setting up some obvious clues, and running with\nthem to their logical conclusion. It's like throwing the reader a bone,\nparticularly those who may be prone to feeling a little overwhelmed by\ngetting perpetually outfoxed by the narrative. Another example of that\nwas Jade's penpal letter. I designed it so that the clues would scream\nGRANDPA GRANDPA GRANDPA, and of course that's what most people were\nguessing. And the guess was very much on the right track. But that\ndoesn't mean it was safe from another twist. It was her grandson, which\nis an outcome still compatible with the original clues, in a way. And\nwhile managing to be surprising, and not particularly guessable. So in\nthat sense I guess that development had the best of both worlds. Letting\npeople pick up on some more obvious clues for a change, and still\ndelivering a surprise.<br/>\n<br/>\nHow guessable something is also relates to how close to the event you\nget. Prior to Eridan's entrance into the room, and even during, the\ndeaths were completely unguessable. After Feferi's death, Kanaya's\nbecomes considerably more so, but still quite uncertain. After her\ndeath, all bets are off. Not only do all deaths thereafter become\nguessable, but in some cases, \"predictable\". That's because it was the\nline between a series of shocking events, and the establishment of an\nactual story pattern. The new pattern serves a purpose, as a sort of\nannouncement that the story is shifting gears, that we're drifting into\nthese mock-survival horror, mock-crime drama segments, driven by\nsuspense more than usual. The suspense has more authority because of all\nthe collateral of unpredictability built up over time, as well as all\nthe typical stuff that helps like long term characterization. But now\nthat the pattern is out in the open, following through with more deaths\nno longer qualifies as unpredictability. Just the opposite, it would now\nbe playing into expectations, which as I said, can be important too.\nThis gear we've switched to is the new normal, and any unpredictability\nto arise thereafter will necessarily be a departure from whatever\ncurrent patterns would indicate.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nFeb 6, 2011 - Feb 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

Did\nyou always want for him to have such a lame death?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nOf course it was lame.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisappointing? I don't think so. More like suitable for everything we knew about the\ncharacter. Which wasn't all that much. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a character who was introduced with horse porn on his walls.\nHis entire presence in the story was a gag. I think literally every\nconversation he had was centered around his obsession with the\nhierarchy, his perverse enjoyment in being bossed around by those under\nhim, and his desire to be subjug(gl)ated by his only land dwelling\nsuperior. He mentioned he didn't think he could raise a hand to the\nhighblood. When it came down to it, he couldn't, not even to save his\nlife. Such was the extent of ridiculous submission fetish. He was\ndevoted to the caste system to a fault, and he died for it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be disappointed is to crave a more challenging or heroic death. Which\nI guess is fine. But to crave a scenario in which a more dynamic duel\noccurs and he rises as some sort of hero would be overestimating the\nrelevance of an utterly marginal character, someone designed to be not\nmuch more than a really strange piece of an ensemble cast. What he\ncontributed to that ensemble was, as I said, completely centered around a\ngag, and I stayed true to the gag to the bitter end. His death was as\nmuch a sight gag as his introduction. This effectively concludes his arc\nas a minor character. (OR DOES IT????)<br/>\n<br/>\nI think of the big picture, and like I say all the time, I consider how\nit reads straight through as opposed to dripped out tortuously for day\nto day analysis and second guessing. In the slow motion of present\nmoment, the readers deal in countless WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IFs, but each\nof those is lacking broader vision. I'm the one keeping track of the big\npicture here, and if I happen to mention that Equius going out with a\nbigger bang would have been kind of dumb, like so many other things on\npeople's wish lists, I guess you just gotta trust me!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nFeb 6, 2011 - Feb 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

The\nestablishment of a colorful cast of kids from a violent race of\npsychopaths whose entire civilization centers around brutality and\nmurder, and watching how kids from such a culture relate to each other\nand come of age. Hivebent began with dark notes relative to Homestuck,\nand only got darker. The scene with Vriska and Tavros in her quest\ncocoon was an example of the escalation in fucked up shit. Present\nevents are even further escalation. It was always going to get much\nworse before it got better. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you got into this story more recently without knowing anything about\nme or what I've done before, and feel the story would be better suited\nwithout the inclusion of the more bizarre elements, or the downright\nNASTYTIMES, all I can say is that's not who I am or what you signed up\nfor.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you know about Humanimals? Probably most of you do. It's a comic I\ndid years ago. I still think it's hilarious, personally. If you do too,\nthen I would bet there aren't many ways in which our senses of humor\ndiffer. But to many it was disturbing, hideous rubbish. In truth, these\ncomics are probably about as unsettling as you can possibly get without\nresorting to violent or sexual content. (if it appears sexual in nature,\nthat is only your imagination at work, trust me)<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/archive/comics/tso/blurbs/00085-h.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.teamspecialolympics.com/comic.php?sec=archive&amp;auth=Blurbs&amp;cid=blurbs/00085-h.gif&amp;blurb=h</a><br/>\n(Edward was on Equius's wall in the latest Flash)<br/>\n<br/>\n[here's where this answer probably gets a bit too long]<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm constantly mining content from my older work to incorporate into\nHomestuck. The instances of this are hard to quantify. Let's talk about\nEquius again. Lot's of people thought he had depth beyond his gags, and\nthat's definitely true. But that wasn't what was relevant about him, to\nme personally. He was always the troll personification of everything\nlike Humanimals I ever did and put on the internet. (Hence is lusus is\nbasically a Humanimal.) I used to do all sorts of weird stuff, reviewing\nobscene furry pornography, making weird collages involving horses, and\njust a whole lot of bizarre shit that didn't make much sense, but I\nthought was funny. The whole span of these endeavors was quite trollish\nin nature, and you will agree if you peruse Humanimals. The fact that it\nputs some people off is part of what makes it funny. So Equius was that\nentire arena of trollish content, rolled into a character. That's why I\nwas STRONGLY committed to maintaining the integrity of his arc, as I\ndefined it. It was more important by far for me to adhere to his role as\nthe fucked up dude who embodies all that stuff than have him blow it by\ndoing something heroic. He believed he died a death of supreme\nintegrity. And so do I.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't get me wrong, he was still a gag character. But this was the\nprecise nature of the gag, an homage to an entire vein of humor I used\nto deal in copiously. He, like some others, trolled you in life, and\nthen trolled you in death. What happened in between, you ask? Well, that\nwas just you falling in love.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhistles was a graphic novel I did years ago. It's another thing I've\nmined ideas from, which have specifically begun to show themselves\nlately with Gamzee's turn. And oddly, there's some of Whistles rolled\ninto Equius too. If Equius seemed to accelerate to a point of depth\nfaster than others, maybe it's because he was built on quite a payload\nof founding concepts, all revolving around perversity.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhistles was about a clown in a circus who was as sweet as could be. He\nloved his ringmaster, in spite of the fact that the master was a\ncannibal and a tyrant who attempted to kill him. When the circus\nrebelled against the master and beat him, Whistles flipped out, killed a\nlot of people, and absconded with the master into the desert. (nice\nclown going murderous is obviously what Gamzee imported from this) The\nrecurring theme throughout the whole comic is that every time Whistles\nhas a chance to do the right thing and rebel against his evil master, he\ncan't overcome his loyalty to him. To the point where he offers his\nstarving master his own severed arm to eat. The whole thing is darkly\nhumorous and pretty messed up. Equius imported this insane reverence for\nthe hierarchy at the expense of his own well being. Though with\nWhistles, it wasn't quite as perverse and didn't have the creepy sexual\nconnotations. (However, at one point Whistles did dabble in\nprostitution. But when he did it, it was cute!)<br/>\n<br/>\nI get asked sometimes if I will make book 2, the conclusion of Whistles.\nThe answer is, probably not. It's incredibly time consuming making a\ngraphic novel, and I don't know where I'll find the time. It also\nprobably just gathered too much dust for me to get into it again. But\nunlike Equius, I did plan on giving Whistles a heroic end. I always\nintended for him to overcome his obsession with his master.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what it's worth, I did finish a draft of book 2's first chapter. It\nintroduces a new villain named Sugarshoe who is, get this, another\ninsane clown! If you read through this and recent HS events, it may seem\nlike I'm obsessed with this kind of thing. Not really. Like I said, I\njust borrow heavily from myself.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/tso/whistles/101\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.andrewhussie.com/comic.php?sec=archive&amp;auth=Andrew&amp;cid=whistles2_draft/whistles2_001.jpg</a><br/>\n<br/>\nJust to wrap up this trivia binge, some other examples of old stuff I've rolled into\nHomestuck are..........<br/>\n<br/>\nSBaHJ. I did a few strips on a whim, satirizing someone's comics, about\none month before I started HS. I folded it into HS as it's primary\nsource of original memes to be referenced ad nauseum. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe whole Bro puppet obsession was largely sparked by this series of\nridiculous muppet comics I did in the forum years ago. One of the comics\nactually made it in HS, pinned on Bro's door for Dave to find. File\nthis under More Fucked Up Shit I did.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/archive/forum/Cheerfulbear%20-%20PLAY%20ME.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mspaforums.com/showthread.php?24118-Cheerfulbear-PLAY-ME</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAll the wizard stuff in Rose's house, and her wizardfic writing in\ngeneral, was mostly imported from my own absurd wizardfic I wrote some\nyears ago, a pretty healthy sized book I never quite finished. It was\ncalled Wizardy Herbert, and was a very flippantly satirical story about\nkids and magic, starting out as what seemed like an unapologetic Harry\nPotter spoof revolving around a magical summer camp instead of a school,\nand then quickly launching off the plot deep end into some very\nconvoluted stuff of Homestuckian proportions. In fact, there are many\nideas mined from this story and injected into Homestuck. Any time you\nread anything about magic being stupid or not being real or anything\nlike that, that's Wizardy Herbert talking. Zazzerpan and his full\nComplacency were minor characters in WH. WH is actually extremely\nsimilar to HS, in terms of the nature of the dialogue, the blend of\nutter silliness and dramatic seriousness, and complexity. It feels like\nsuch a similar thing to me, this might be the main reason why I'll never\nquite finish it.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters from WH are on Rose's wall here. <a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/mspa/002121\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=002121</a><br/>\n<br/>\nHerbert is the guy with the eye patch. He had a magic gun. But he could\nnever figure out how to use magic, so he primarily just went around\nshooting things. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway I guess that's enough about all that.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nFeb 9, 2011 - ~Feb 13, 2011?\n\n</div>"

That is what it still is, in my view, which appears to differ\nwith the reality inside your own personal factsphere. So be it.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut using Problem Sleuth as a comparison is silly. Problem Sleuth had\nvery little in the way of a plot, and the characters were mute foils for\noutrageous shenanigans. The dark events, which were rare, happened in a\nframework in which investment was limited. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Midnight Crew intermission would serve as a better comparison\nanyway, since it was essentially a bloodbath. But it's still the same\nkind of thing. Stick figure characters with no actual personality\ngetting knocked off left and right for laughs. If you ask I apply the\nexact same standards of \"dark lite\" to HS, I say this is not possible.\nKilling a character beyond stick figure depth will necessarily carry\nmore weight, and will be read by some as a turn for the GRIMDARK. So in\ntruth your advice is to kill no one, and proceed gutlessly, or risk\nbeing likened to a comic book from the 1990's. I suggest viewing this as\nan attempt to be edgy and therefore artistic is a pretty shallow way to\ninterpret what is happening.<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back on the MC intermission again, it was a pretty prescient\nsegment. It foretold of a great deal of time travel complexity yet to\ncome in the story. It turns out there was a bloodbath in the cards as\nwell. There are many ways to examine past events and not be surprised by\nwhat is taking place now. Not the least of which is that these children\nwere introduced as members of a race of psychopathic murderers. Some of\nyour jaws still seem to be on the floor, and I guess I wonder what\nthey're still doing there.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nFeb 9, 2011 - ~Feb 13, 2011?\n\n</div>"

But\nseriously, the one panel a page approach looks like it allows for more\ncohesive storytelling. Do you feel that other authors, forced to add a\npunchline, weaken their work/drama?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nWell, if you have to force a punchline, then the punchline\nshouldn't even exist, should it? The whole comic shouldn't exist. By\nextension, there are entire webcomics out there that should not exist.\n(Won't say which ones tho! hehehehehehehehehehe.)<br/>\n<br/>\nBut really, one problem with normal comics I think is when you have\npages chock full of panels, sometimes a lot of those panels just get\nglazed over by the reader as background wallpaper, even though they may\nbe very attractive if examined, and a great deal of care was put into it\nby the artist. It's sort of a shame.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith each panel given focus, they demand attention and can have more\npower individually, and create more surprising statements as navigated\nthrough. This is true even if one of my panels is literally just me\nscribbling bullshit all over it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the real HAYMAKER of this format is being able to deliver any\nquantity of text below the image I want. Anywhere from 0 to 100,000\ncharacters. I can fit entire conversations in one panel which would\nrequire HUNDREDS of normal comic panels to convey gracefully. I always\nfound dialogue-dense comics a bit offputting, wherein all the dialogue\nis stuffed into a lot of ponderous bubbles crowding out the art. With\nthis format, this is not an issue at all. Large volumes of text may\ncoexist with the art innocuously, as if you are reading a true\ncomic/novel hybrid.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yeah, + animation's cool too I guess.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\n~Feb 13, 2011? - Mar 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

She does not need to embellish on anything because she is\nthe real deal. A very successful and nefarious troll pirate who exploits\nher powers in battle and romance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is one of those things that is equal parts serious and silly (well\nok maybe not totally equal). It is in part serious in the sense that you\ncan view it totally straight and read it as a series of events that\nliterally happened, and has implications for the story. It is also in\npart COMPLETELY FUCKING RIDICULOUS because you are truly, literally\nreading an excerpt of trashy romance, involving pirates like some Fabio\nnovel, all parsed through a grim troll culture and the strange\nmulti-dimensionality of troll romance.<br/>\n<br/>\nOnce all the dust WTF settles, you can look at it from a variety of angles.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince this is the ancestor Vriska idolizes, this is probably the exact\ntype of character she'd grow up to be, if left unfettered in troll\nsociety. If there is any departure in her inclinations, this is the\ntemplate she is departing from. We've already seen her try to do her\nMindfang impression a few times with mixed results. She tried to get\nTavros to kiss her with mind control, but couldn't go through with it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen put into the perspective of more severe adult troll attitudes, I\nthink it helps make everything the trolls have done so far seem more\nchildish in retrospect. It was hard to gauge, because adult troll life\nwas completely abstract. Hearing a little from one adult's perspective\nthrough this romfic shows how big the gap was between their youthful\nantics and what they were really trying to become.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt also puts a little perspective on why certain relationships are the\nway they are, seeing how their ancestral counterparts interacted (in\nthis case, Vriska and Eridan, whose ancestor was Dualscar, which was the\nname of his RP character as well). But we still only have the one\nexample to go on so far.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the topic of Vriska reading this thing for inspiration, to me\nit's kind of got the feel of a cross between a kid learning about a\nrelative she looks up to, delighting in reading some unapologetically\ntrashy romance novel, AND the troll equivalent of stumbling on her\nparent's porn stash. Which is not to say the entire journal is full of\nsmut. But hey, there it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd lastly, you can look at the log as further insight into the nature\nof troll romance, their near-universal bisexuality, their apparently\ncasual attitudes toward the multiple partners the quadrants demand, the\ntension surrounding the potential of hopping quadrants and the meaning\nof envy in this regard, an element of mysterious affection that still\nseems to surround the hate-based black relationships, and a certain\ndegree of open promiscuity implied by the actions here.

Rather than being a swapped preference, it is\na more exacting preference. Somewhat like a fetish for a particular\ngender. When Karkat was talking to John about it, he indicated trolls\ndon't even have a word for the orientation. It's not something that\nappears to have any cultural significance to them. Which might seem odd,\nbut then, they're aliens. Maybe a way to view it is how we view people\nwith more exacting preferences, like certain fetishists. We don't\nactually have common words to describe most people like that, and their\npresence doesn't have nearly the same social ramifications which\nhomosexuality does. Humans seem to make a very big deal out of\nhomosexuality, while treating other forms of preference as barely worth\nnoting. When Karkat was &lt;3&lt; hitting on John, the reasonable human\nresponse was to say \"I am not a homosexual.\" But the troll response\nwould be more like \"Sorry, not interested,\" without invoking\norientation. Very much like a guy with a fat fetish isn't too likely to\nreject a thin girl by saying \"Sorry, I am just this HUGE chubby chaser,\nso I must decline.\" (CUE FAT VRISKA JOKES AGAIN)<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that any of this changes how we view Kanaya.

        "html": "<div class=\"question-container\"><h2><a href=\"/formspring/question167585470568502441\">Why did Tavros\nwrite \"t1ck\" when all of the other trolls wrote according to their quirk?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nA small exception to the pattern. But we can examine a few reasons why it makes\nsense.<br/>\n<br/>\nAradia's quirk is to replace 'o' with '0', making t0ck. Using a '1' for\nt1ck not only balances the numerology, but adds a binary element to the\nphrase. Duality/bifurcation has always been a strong theme in the\ntrolls' session. Two teams, two sets of ruins, two universes.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also a pretty solid case to be made for why Tavros should\nrepresent 1. Aradia has always used zeroes because she had been the\n\"null character\", before her resurrection. Sollux on the other hand had\nalways been the character of duality, with his twofold curse. When\nAradia came back to life, she lost her null quality, and thus lost her\nquirk. Sollux lost his twofold curse when he went blind, and lost his\nquirk too. But he, in a way, assumed Aradia's position as the null\ncharacter, insofar as 2-2=0. He assumed her quirk. This is aside from\nthe point about Tavros though. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you list the trolls according to the order of the zodiac, it starts with:<br/>\n<br/>\n0: Aradia<br/>\n1: Tavros<br/>\n2: Sollux<br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, if beginning with 0, which is suitable for Aradia's theme, then\nSollux is also numbered suitably as well. That makes Tavros the 1 troll\nby default. Does the number 1 have significance for his character\nbeyond this? Bet you can think of your own reasons if I left you to it.\nHere's a pretty good one for me: Tavros is so lame, he's always\nforgotten to type with the number ruling his existence, and it is only\nthrough writing this code that the quirk has been awakened.<br/>\n<br/>\nVriska's number is obviously 8. Scorpio is in fact the eighth sign on\nthe list too, assuming we switch to begin counting at 1 from the start\nin this case. Which we should, because we aren't actually being that\nliteral about assigning a number to each troll. It only makes sense for a\nfew of them. Some of their numbers don't even register on a 1-12 scale.\nEquius likes 100, while Nepeta is all about 33.<br/>\n<br/>\n8 has always been kind of a special number in HS, in the same way 413\nhas, though not hit as hard as those digits have been. In fact, 4+1+3=8!\n<br/>\n<br/>\n413 are Terezi's numbers. She uses them as her quirk, as the numerals of\nthe blind prophets. If we are to say Vriska is 8, then Terezi is right\nbehind her on the zodiac list, and she would be 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nHer code \"H34DS\" conveniently includes no 1. 3+4=7!!! There's her number, rearing\nits head.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere did the 1 go? Tavros has it! It seems writing these codes while\nsleepwalking has cajoled the true numbers assigned to Tavros and Terezi,\n1 and 7, out of their subconscious. <br/>\n<br/>\nOk, so some of this sounds a bit like hand waving I'm sure. No single\nreason here is ESPECIALLY compelling for giving Tavros a 1 on its own,\nbut I submit that we have overwhelmed the jury with circumstantial\nevidence, and I expect a conviction.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMar 2, 2011 - Mar 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

But I guess character\ndevelopment tends to help.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith Scratch, I think one of the fun things about his recent\ndevelopments is that they came on the heels of learning that he is part\nCal. His identity as a creepy pervert wasn't exactly \"set up\" before\nthis revelation. Not overtly. But if it was I think it would be less\nentertaining. We get to watch certain traits of his personality reveal\nthemselves exactly when we now have reason to expect those traits. If he\nhad them before it might have weakened the humor value of it now, even\nthough it would have been more air tight from a characterization and\nplot construction standpoint. We didn't get to say \"DIABOLICAL! So\nTHAT'S why he's a perv!\" But HS has enough of those eureka moments\nalready for us to be worrying about that.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot that his developments are completely off the wall either. He was\nalways a pretty self satisfied guy, with the demeanor of someone who\ncould easily be a coy prankster, who just hadn't revealed those\ntendencies yet. Much of what he said had the feel of a knowitall who's\njust messing with someone. Also, he did only talk to the girls. With the\nexception of the one short line to Karkat. He manipulated them and\nmentored them in weird ways, and eventually one might ask, why all the\nattention on the ladies dude??? So turns out that's why, sort of. Of\ncourse the original reason was more pragmatic. It was just that of all\nthe trolls, the ones most relevant and dynamic in the story tended to be\ngirls, so that's who he talked to. But later, it struck me as a pretty\namusing angle on an omniscient character to be a bit of a creeper, and\nthis is in keeping with his origin. <br/>\n<br/>\nRemember where Cal came from in the first place? And why he was thrown out of Dave's\ndream tower?<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"/mspa/003621\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=6&amp;p=003621</a><br/>\n<br/>\nBut all that said I still don't think it's quite right to regard him as\nan actual pedophile, just because of what sort of entity he is. It's\nprobably more apt to think of him as an all knowing supercomputer that\nhappens to have a gravitation toward young ladies in his programming.\nImagine walking up to the computer and if you are a boy it says, hey.\nBut if you are a girl it says WELL HELLO, DON'T YOU LOOK NICE. Thinking\nof it in these terms helps make it funny rather than outright\ndisturbing.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMar 8, 2011 - Mar 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

The labor involved in\nmaking a Flash animation is pretty goddamn ridiculous. I'm approaching\nthe 2 year mark on Homestuck, and in addition to the thousands of static\npages and many tens of thousands of words, I am standing on several\nhours of animated footage. This is, frankly, ludicrous. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot that there is any regret in this accumulation. But after a point, an\nassessment has to be made whether such sustained high intensity is\nworthwhile, and whether it continues serving the purpose it originally\nhad. It's purposes being media exploration, pushing the envelope on\nstory delivery, and so on. The envelope can't always be pushed farther\nwhile still justifying the effort. If the effort required increases,\nwhile reader reaction inevitably flattens and adjusts to the\nexpectation, then that particular purpose is not really being satisfied\nanymore. As far as media exploration goes, I think there's probably more\nthan enough dynamism in the animated portion of this work to cover my\ninitial agenda for it (which is to say, it far surpasses it). And as\nreader reaction catalysts, they probably stopped having the eye-widening\nimpact they once had, where they were very often transforming your\nunderstanding of what this story was, and what it could be, and catching\npeople off guard by humbling what preceded it. Without that\nexperiential payload, they become a part of a pretty homogeneous loaf\nthat represents MSPA as a product, something that demands a consistent\nmouth feel when chewed, and Flash must be tasted before swallowed. This\nis a situation I am not HUUUGELY interested in committing all of my time\nto keeping propped up, and Flash animations were not actually meant to\nbe part of MSPA's Pledge To The Consumer.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo all that's really left, and this has been true for a while I guess,\nis whether I feel like doing a Flash and whether I'll enjoy it. I can\nsay that the end to every act will definitely involve a Flash animation.\nBut beyond that, I don't know. It's possible I might not do a Flash\nbetween now and the end of A5. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr I might! We'll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut what might not be fruitful is trying to read the gaps in my schedule\nlike tea leaves, and divine the nature of upcoming output. Often, in\nthe Flash frenzied history of HS's reckless climb, interpreting such\ngaps in this way has been reliable. Maybe not so much here on out!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMar 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

If you don't understand this, then you don't understand\nHS very well. SBaHJ is like the mentally handicapped step brother of\nMSPA, requiring special attention, but no less cherished as a part of\nthe family. It was originally intended as the chief source of in-house\nmemes for dialogue, but this is ultimately a superficial purpose. Though\nit only has 20+ strips, it contains a pretty dense and internally\nconsistent language of recurring symbols and typo-driven grammars,\napplicable as a rich sub-cognitive lexicon for highlighting elusive\nelements woven into the mythology of the story which tend to be shrouded\nin the unconscious. <br/>\n<br/>\nMany times events in SBaHJ \"foreshadow\" what happens in HS, but this is\npractically never intentional. It is always retroactive on my part, and\nquite convenient. Like the vampire strip I drew shortly before Kanaya's\ndeath and resurrection. The correlation was convenient, and was\nemphasized in the comic as a gag. Same with the one with Bro achieving\nLIFDOFF, passing a cloud labeled \"cloun\". Soon after, John flew his car\nby a cloud that showed Gamzee in it. This was unintentional while\ndrawing the SBaHJ, but the connection was soon made in the comic\nserendipitously. <br/>\n<br/>\nSBaHJ as a creative process is probably a pretty accurate reflection of\nmy subconscious at work. This may be why it often ties into HS themes\nyet to develop. It is like I am a prophet of my own story, and these\nshitty comics are my cryptic messages. I submit to the trance of the\nJPEGothics, while quaking in the losseldritch throes of the artifact\ntongues. The resulting imagery is troubling, and AGGRESSIVELY PREGNANT\nwith meaning.<br/>\n<br/>\nThough most aspects of HS's story construction is exceedingly\nmeticulous, with multi-threaded plot connections established months or\nyears in advance, intuition plays a powerful role too, and may be even\nmore important than the maniacal, overly cerebral stuff. There are\noccasions where something will just FIT, in a weirdly perfect way, even\nthough I didn't quite intend it. I always seems to be working favorably\nwith the grain of positive coincidence. Strange things with numbers\nhappen all the time, for example, and this is certainly not because I'm a\nskilled numerologist. The troll's number is 612 because I started\nHivebent on 6/12, a tale of 12 6 sweep-olds (13 year-olds). Their names\nare 6 and 6 letters, like mine. Why is one sweep = 2.16 years? Weird.\nWhy is 6/12/11 exactly one sweep from 4/13/09, the start date of HS???\nAlso weird. These occurrences are everywhere, and I can only assume they\nhave their root in the turbulent void from which all this comes. The\nstory is in part driven furiously by high level cerebral machinations,\nand in part at the mercy of the whims of my waking coma. And I,\npersonally, am at the mercy of it all.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, if for no other reason, this is why you should like SBaHJ, or at\nleast find it intriguing. Frankly, I am quite suspicious of anyone who\ndoesn't find it funny. I am suspicious of their judgment and quality of\nperception. This is probably because it means their minds are\nincompatible with mine on a such a profound level. They are at odds with\nmy subconscious.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded to <span class=\"user\">thekslice</span>,\n\nMar 17, 2011 - Apr 2, 2011\n\n</div>"

We've made plenty of\nprogress, but it's still not there.<br/>\n<br/>\nTry to remember that as a key date approaches, I actually have much less\ntime to make that work than it seems. To make 4/13 work for EOA5, I'd\nneed AT LEAST a solid week to work on it, probably more. Which means I'd\nhave to get the story up to that exact precipice in less than a week\nfrom now, and frankly, I've got other shit to do.

While\ntrolling is antagonistic it is often done in a way that is supposed to\nbe funny, after all.</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nThe terms are not synonymous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is trolling involved when Dave makes self-aware references to the\ncallback heavy style of the story's construction? Where is the intent to\nagitate? There is no editorial subtext. There is nothing to read\nbetween the lines. There is no veiled repudiation, and I am not saying\n\"suck it bitches!\" to those who disagree with the callback saturation\n(those people don't even exist). It is merely a couple of lines of\ndialogue which are silly and self referential. It is a joke.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also not trolling when I leave something on a cliffhanger. It is\nstandard dramatic practice. It is also fairly unavoidable when there are\nmany story threads running at once. You have to switch to others at\nsome point. You also cannot answer every question at once or distribute\nevery payoff when they are demanded, or a very nonlinear story would\nbecome very linear very quickly. It is additionally unavoidable because\nthere are few occasions when you don't want to know what happens next.\nHence every switch of focus begins to resemble a cliffhanger. This\npattern has also been brought to attention through self aware humor, a\nla 5x cliffhanger combo gags and such. This does not count as trolling\neither. These are yet more gags of self reference. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some moments when trolling comes into play. When tension\nmounts in a scene and we are being lead to expect something significant,\nand then you read the word \"psyche\", that is clearly a form of\ntrolling. When I am dressed up as a troll, and copying large volumes of\ntext into the narrative specifically to spite you, the reader, and I am\nsaying \"I am trolling you right now by doing this\" it is safe to say you\nare being trolled. And even this flagrant gesture is one step removed\nfrom the act of genuine trolling, through the partition of satire. The\nentire concept of trolling has been folded into the story as another\nsource of raw material for absurd kinds of exploitation, like computer\nscience, alchemy, sprawling chess metaphors, and suit-based alien\nromance. This does not mean every joke is an act of trolling, or\nmeta-trolling. In fact, very few are. When you read a simple\nself-referential joke or have your expectations subverted in in some way\nand say HUSSIE'S TROLLING US AGAIN, you sound silly. You sound like you\ndon't understand what trolling is, or what I'm actually doing here.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nApr 7, 2011 - Apr 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

        "html": "<div class=\"question-container\"><h2><a href=\"/formspring/question182810348053629836\">How many\nquestions have you got from people complaining about there not being a flash\nupdate (up until this point, at least)?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nI don't know. I hardly ever read more than half way down the first page of\nquestions. Too many, too repetitive, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut through various channels, I detect certain flavors of reaction,\nranging from disappointment to frustration to something faintly\nresembling outrage, not just at the lack of an incendiary production to\nmark year 2, but also the flagging rate of output in recent weeks.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese reactions are far from universal, but they exist, and to address\nthem I think an education on why MSPA exists at all is in order. If you\nsee a creator who begins to languish in production of what presumably\naccounts for his day job, the impression may be that he is falling down\non the job and failing to live up to his professional commitment. So\nmaybe this is the source of indignation, re: entitlement, that some may\nfeel when my output falters. The problem is, MSPA is not a day job for\nme. It is an all consuming lifestyle. Hence, the mirage that is the\napparent ease of output for what is at times ludicrous volumes of\nmaterial is highly sensitive to even slight perturbations in my life\nsituation. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me put it this way. You may work a full time job. It may be that\nsomething happens in your life that makes your job more difficult,\nbecause you are preoccupied. Your work may suffer to some extent, but\nyou can still approximately match what's expected of you, because there\nis a partition between your job and your home life. You may nevertheless\nfeel your full time job seems to dominate your existence, saps your\nenergy, and leaves your weekend respites feeling all too short. This is\nnot an experience I share, because MSPA is not a full time job. If you\nhave such a job, then I would have to RADICALLY REDUCE my workload to\nmatch your level of day to day preoccupation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe actual quantities involved have always been nebulous and I never\nmade a point of keeping track, but 12 hours per day seems like a pretty\nreasonable average, since that is just shy of all waking hours. Time\nspent writing, drawing, animating, or just spacing out at my monitor\nwhile contemplating all the moving parts. This is what I did every day,\nincluding weekends and holidays, for two years, and to some extent\nanother year prior to that with Problem Sleuth. Only a few weekends were\nmissed due to conventions, and there was a single week off immediately\nfollowing the infamous \"robo smooch\", and that's it. (Most of that week\nwas spent wondering why the hell I wasn't updating...) There are other\ngaps in the archive, spanning days or a week, when I was animating.\nThose spans involved the usual work schedule, while simply omitting\nsleep!<br/>\n<br/>\nNot only is this an unreasonable workload to expect of anyone, it's\npractically impossible to pull it off. Maybe you can expect some\ncommitted guy out there to really buckle down and duplicate that effort\nfor a month or two. But years? Too much can crop up in the white noise\nof normal life to destabilize it. Momentum is absolutely crucial for\nmaintaining that kind of pace. I find that if I only do an hour of work\nin a day, I get ten minutes of work done. If I do 12 hours of work, I\nseem to get 24 hours of work done. This is especially true of animation.\nSuch projects notoriously take a very long time. I feel like because of\nthe crazy head of steam I've built up from years of nonstop effort, I\ncan knock out in days something that might take another animator a week.\nOr in a week what might take a month. Without that momentum, it's not\npossible. Starting up Flash cold is excruciating. Getting your head back\ninto the stride of a story wastes energy you wouldn't use if you never\nbroke stride. Without the momentum, the pace reverts to ordinary.\nGetting distracted by life destroys the momentum. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've been pretty zealous about deflecting the distractions, even when I\nmove, as I often do. A notable example was last year when I came back\nfrom the Emerald City con in Seattle, and found my apartment flooded.\nThe con was already enough of a time sink, so I didn't have much of an\nappetite for going into personal crisis mode. I just kind of shrugged,\npicked my computer off the lone, miraculously dry part of the floor,\ndropped it in a temporary residence, and kept drawing. I think the flood\nmess occupied about a day of my attention, whereas something like that\ncould easily take up weeks of your time and energy if you're living that\n\"normal life\". You know how it is, you come home and find water up to\nyour ankles and go aw fuck, what's ruined, what needs replacing, gotta\ncall whoever and deal with the fuckin landlord about stuff and auuuugh. I\njust didn't bother with any of that, because it just didn't seem to\nmatter, and I preferred to keep working and not give a crap about all my\nsoggy bullshit. And in retrospect, I guess it really didn't matter. <br/>\n<br/>\nAll of my moves have been similarly characterized by the unceremonious\ntransportation of a computer and a few boxes to a new room, in which I'd\ncontinue working as if no change took place, with no service paid to\nthe life that would be lived there, except as a workspace. I moved again\nrecently, prompted by decidedly less dramatic and less soggy reasons\nthan after Emerald City. This time, for whatever reason, I did it\ndifferently. I moved the normal way, the way I imagine normal people\ndoing when I close my eyes, whereby more than a car trunk full of\nutilitarian belongings are imported into the household, placed on the\nfloor, and never unpacked until the next moving day. I am not\nnecessarily PROHIBITIVELY busy, but like I said above, any dent in the\nmomentum, whether its a few trips to Home Depot or Target here and there\nor somehow waking up to discover I'd absconded from a shelter with two\nparticularly energetic young cats, is something that precludes a pace of\noutput that is insane and often bordering on miraculous.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm trying to convey here is this isn't necessarily any sort of\nbreak, or a grand announcement of a big slowdown for MSPA. I'm trying to\ngive you a sense of the reality which made MSPA heretofore possible,\nand that if for a period of time I descend from an altitude far\nexceeding the hours of a full time job, into \"merely\" those of a full\ntime job, IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY COUNT AS A BREAK! And certainly not as any\nsort of violation in a pact with the readership. Different from what\nyou're used to? Sure. But you should never find yourself in a position\nwhere you come to expect, let alone demand, that degree of effort from\nanyone, even me. If my output \"sputters\" from 10 pages a day to 1 or 2\nor 3, IDEALLY (re: unrealistically) this should not even cause you to\nvoice an internal observation on the matter! And if one is voiced,\ninstead of \"oops, looks like Andrew's slipping,\" it should be \"oops,\nlooks like Andrew's being a regular dude for a while.\" <br/>\n<br/>\nNot that detecting a pace change is some terrible wrongdoing, since\nclearly I've done everything in my power to establish these absurd\nprecedents, and people have naturally associated this with The Brand.\nI'd just like to suggest it would be beneficial to the reader to\ndisentangle enjoyment of the content from the torrid pace its been\ncommonly delivered. Who can say how fast or slow it'll come in year\nthree? Would my assurances even be reliable? Maybe it'll stay at the\ncurrent pace for a good long while. Maybe it'll soon hasten back to\nsomething more typical. Maybe it'll come back FASTER THAN EVER. Who\ncares??? Do you really NEED this site to be the fastest comic on the\nblock to enjoy it? Are you prepared to contend with the backlash to your\npsyche that is risked by so fervently relishing that particular\nproperty of the comic? What if it's taken away? Don't go boasting to\nyour neighbors that your slave can pick cotton ten times faster than\ntheirs. It's unbecoming. Just enjoy the fluffy yield of his furious\nhands, while you wait and pray for Abe Lincoln to gently stroke his\nbeard and relieve you of your bigotry.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nApr 7, 2011 - Apr 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

They made me so very very happy.\nBUT GET ON WITH IT, LAD</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nTo be fair, if I were working at \"normal speed\", updates over\nthe last 5 days could easily have been compressed into one day. I kinda\ndoubt anybody would be urging me to get on with it if that were the\ncase.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, here is some additional perspective on the matter of the pressing need\nfor plot advancement.<br/>\n<br/>\nDo you recall that at one point, WV spent about three weeks fucking\naround with cans in a bunker before he finally blasted off? In Act 1, we\nwatched John launch cakes out of his sylladex for two months before we\neven discovered the story had a plot.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is how this works. At times it advances through stretches of\nunremarkable events wherein characters are given space to fool around.\nThe story then continues to build on the details that accumulate. That\nis how every story on this website has been created, and the practice\nhas been adhered to religiously. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes, even in the heat of my most productive periods, these\n\"goofing around phases\" still represent a kind of decompression. When I\nam just not quite ready to ATTACK major plot advancement in the manner\nthat it would require, and it's simpler and more sustainable to mess\naround, do silly things, and keep production relatively light weight.<br/>\n<br/>\nI remember when WV was horsing around with Can Town, there were similar\nmurmurs of impatience, and many believed firmly it couldn't possibly be\ngoing anywhere that served the story. Nobody could know his big can in\nthe desert would blast off soon, let alone that a year later, for\nreasons they couldn't yet fathom, thousands of teenagers to smear gray\nmakeup all over their faces because of stuff that happened in this\nstory. What could possibly happen later that would cause this??? Pretty\nhard to imagine, when you're the guy in December of '09, impatiently\nwaiting for WV to eat parts of a pumpkin, drink Tab, and play chess with\nhimself.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo find out, you had to be in it for the long haul, as you must now be. I\nwill do what I am going to do, and one way or another, it will get\nwhere it's headed. It always does.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nApr 16, 2011 - Apr 20, 2011\n\n</div>"

Not\nworking on a thing 24/7 shouldn't really need an explanation. Like\nnobody goes up to you and asks you why you aren't working on a thing\n24/7, because that's a nutty thing to ask someone. Unless you have\ntrained a very large population to expect this behavior from you over an\nuninterrupted period spanning three years. In which case my strong\nadvice to such a person who has done that is: ???????????????<br/>\n<br/>\nThe animation took 4 days or so, but really it wasn't especially long\nand something like that should have taken me about 2 days or maybe less\nif I were working in Hell Mode. But I had a lot of other important\nthings to do which stretched out the time. For instance, watching some\nepisodes of 30 Rock. I also ran some unsuccessful errands, like I went\nto the UPS Store to mail my stupid broken iPhone back to Apple, because\nit's dumb and broken and I kind of hate it. But the UPS Store's computer\nwasn't working or something, so I left. I went back again another day,\nbut it was the same story. I muddled around with some tweens and and\ncajoled a billion little image files, saved in photoshop one by one and\nimported into Flash which is technology on par with a broken iphone in\nterms of raw aggravation factor. I went to Starbucks a bunch of times\nand bought some coffee, and at one point I netflixed Robocop on the PS3,\nand wound up fast forwarding through all the scenes where he was\nsitting around without his helmet on looking weird and talking about his\nrobofeelings, because the movie wasn't really as good as I wanted to\nremember it being. I horsed around with some cats, by which I guess I\nmean coexisted with them which is mostly all you do with a pet\nultimately. The younger one has taken to nursing on the slightly not as\nyoung one, which is weird because she is like her adopted older sister\nwho is barely even much bigger than her. But the older one seems fine\nwith it and actually starts purring, because pretty much every cat in\nthe world is as least partially insane. At some point I realized I\nshould stop shitting around and get down to fucking business. I dug deep\ndown to tap into my inner reserves of determination and strength, and\nwith all of my mettle brought to bear on the task I buckled down and was\nfinally able to watch another 10 or 15 episodes of 30 Rock.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then I finished the animation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for what I did today, i.e. the day after posting it, I don't know.\nMostly sitting around thinking about how I want to execute some stuff\ncoming up next, and revising some overly ambitious plans which were\ncertainly made in the heat of labor-addled delirium. Also I did some\nother stuff. I made some pasta, and drove some cardboard boxes\nsomewhere. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat did you do today? :)\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nApr 30, 2011\n\n</div>"

I can at\nthis point count on gifts of Faygo, Gushers, and candy corn at any\nconvention with total certainty.) The fellow opened the Faygo with\nshowman's aplomb, and the bottle snorted an angry, umbrella shaped jet\nof atrocious cola on to himself, his belongings, and all who surrounded\nhim. I showed my contrition by looking suitably horrified. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe convention only occupied the weekend, but in truth its footprint\nspanned 5 solid days when you account for travel time on thursday and\nmonday, horsing around in Toronto on friday, and may even span 7 days\nwhen you consider how useless a person can be on the days before and\nafter traveling extensively. So that is an entire week existing as a\nblack hole in my creative schedule on account of two pretty decent days\nin Canada. This is probably why I don't do a lot of cons.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of momentum killers, the preceding weekend my computer\nbroke, so I bought a new one and spent time setting it up. I don't ever\ntry to fix computers anymore. I just buy new ones, and copy my files\nover. I've learned not to fight with computers over the years. Expending\nthe energy to win these little skirmishes is not worth the years it\nshaves off the end of your life. It steals a lot of time just to\ndiagnose problems, let alone agonize through solutions. Paying for\nservice and new parts and such also takes time, not to mention money\nwhich could be applied toward a brand new computer which doesn't hate\nyou yet. You should take my advice. The next time some device gives you\nproblems, don't fight with it. Just acknowledge to the device, \"You win.\nYou are broken. You will be replaced immediately.\" This is a liberating\npolicy. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe thing is, a computer isn't even very expensive. You can get a pretty\nalright one for like $300 or $400. My disc drive failed. Yes, a\nscratched disc. We'll forgo mention of HS themes cropping up in my life\ncause I don't even know what to say about that. I've had drives fail\nbefore, which basically happens for no reason. It's something they do.\nIt's a good thing nothing important depends on hard drives being\nreliable. Except I guess practically all of modern civilization, but\nwhatever. So I'd have to buy a new hard drive for $100 or so, a fuckin\ncopy of goddamn Windows (which I don't even have, I always just inherit\nOS's from new machines) for like $200, and jump through all these hoops,\nor just spend approximately the same amount of money on some dumb\npre-assembled machine off a store rack that is hot and ready to go, and\nremain blissfully uninvolved with a piece of technology's staggering,\nintractable neurosis. I just copy my files over. When a drive dies, it\nnever actually spoils your data much. It only ever seems to break just\nenough to make the OS go funky, and difficult/impossible to boot up. And\nthe more you run it, the more it corrupts, which is why you stop\nimmediately, forfeit all hope of salvaging it, and buy a new computer. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven though that was about as painless a solution as possible, it was\nstill a significant momentum drain, and last week was pretty slow\ncontent-wise. So's this one. Momentum drags are pretty common these\ndays. That's just the shape of things, and it's all been fastidiously\nfiled under Oh Well already, so don't worry.<br/>\n<br/>\nTCAF amounted to about a week long black hole of output, through which\nnot only did you get to not read anything, but I was not even remotely\napplying effort toward something you will read later. That effort begins\nonly now, as I get my shit together, and puzzle over the plans I left\ndangling. These plans are usually kept rational and aloft in my mind\nthrough perpetual, feverish creative activity. They begin to resemble\nthe overambitious boondoggles they truly are when I'm forced to slow\ndown. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm presently puzzling over is why I decided to leave a Flash\nproject for myself to return to. Not really the best idea. But it'll be\ndone when it's done, even if the gap in the archive from 5/5 to 5/? will\nprobably seem cavernous relative to the eventual payoff. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck the site again:<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;strikethru&gt;Tomorrow&lt;/strikethru&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;strikethru&gt;The next day&lt;/strikethru&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n&lt;fakehtml&gt;The day after that&lt;/bullshit&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nThe future.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMay 10, 2011 - May 13, 2011\n\n</div>"

Did one of the art team members create them, or is this a\nvariation on your usual style?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nI drew an initial template, and the art folks were invited to\ncontinue in that style, adding new animation frames, characters, etc.\nAll very loosely, without a lot of parameters beyond that. Eyes5 did the\nJack, myluckyseven did a Rose frame. There should be more to come.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was originally going to be a Flash project, but I cancelled it.<br/>\n<br/>\nEverything happening now, and over the next bunch of pages, would have\ntaken place in a pretty energetic, and much more sophisticated than\nusual strife animation. Kind of like \"strife version 2\", for the second\ndisc. I planned this idea months ago, not really thinking much of the\neffort and time it would eventually require to complete. This is what I\nusually do, blithely make such ambitious plans, pay the price later, but\nfight through it with a major grind and honor the original vision.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was a little different though. Not only was this meant to be a much\nmore elaborate type of animation by my own stakes-raising declaration,\nwith more frames-intensive visuals like a typical 2D fighter, but on top\nof that, the rate of output had been slowing, and the story flow was\nalready kind of logjamming. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I had to make a decision. I could either apply what I now estimate\nwould have been two or three solid weeks of serious effort to make this\none pretty cool animation, and watch several 100K people sink into a\nstate of despair over the prolonged suspension in content only to have\nthe story advance not particularly far through a totally radical battle\nscene, or I could scrap the whole plan and figure something else out.\nThe latter is what you're seeing.<br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes these adjustments have to be made. I've revised plans before,\nand had some cool ideas I've scrapped. I was going to include another\nround in the Dave vs. Bro battle where they used their Sylladexes to\nwage a hashrap battle (which is why I went to the trouble of making Dave\ncollect all that dangerous shit in his kitchen before climbing to the\nroof). But I axed that because the battle was already taking too much\ntime to produce and bottlenecking plot advancement. That idea was pretty\neasily phased out. This is different now, because revising these plans\nmeant I had to change the way a large chunk of the story would be\ndelivered, because a lot of story components were all tangled up in my\nplans for that animation. So I had to do a lot of rethinking, and much\nof the solution is what you're seeing now, which is having the scratched\ndisc interfere with the flow of the story, and Scratch taking over\nnarration duties at an accelerated pace while he fixes the disc in time\nfor the end of act. This is in part my way of committing not to doing\nanymore flash stuff until the EOA, which itself is going to be a very\nlaborious thing and will take a long time to finish.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is all fine. I don't mind turning my plans upside down sometimes,\nsince it can lead to creative opportunities for handling this stuff. The\ndisc errors, Scratch hijacking the site design while narrating, all\nthis strikes me as in keeping with the spirit of the story and the\nflexible format. Keeping the story moving is important, but it's not the\nsole consideration. MSPA for me is about working with loads of fun\nideas, both for the story itself and the way it's told. Very often that\nconsideration is at odds with pacing. I do what I can to balance both.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest challenge in this respect by far has been Flash. I'm quite\nambivalent on its role in Homestuck. On one hand, it completely changes\nthe way the story is read and perceived, for the better I think. It\nbrings a lot of the most important parts of the story to life, makes for\nsignificant dramatic impact when needed, and goes a long way in making\nthis difficult to classify as a medium. One the other hand, it magnifies\nthe production complexity exponentially, and I'm not just talking about\nthe effort the animations require. It affects everything about my\napproach to the story. Including the whole decision making process, and\nnot in a particularly good way, at least not from my perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest way it affects the process is how it stretches the story\nout. If I'd gone through with the axed strife animation, that would be\nan obvious example, pausing the story a couple weeks to make some people\nfight. But the delaying effects can be more subtle than that. I'll have\nin mind a certain event in the story which I think should be handled\nthrough Flash. I'll know it's coming up, but I might not be ready to\nlaunch into that kind of work for whatever reason. Maybe it's too soon\non the heels of the last one or whatever. So I'll work on more static\npanels, because there is never a shortage of plot threads to address or\ndetails to develop or funny conversations to write or new fun ideas to\nput out there. And that's fine really, since I feel like it's all good\nstuff, but it definitely makes for the long road. I'm quite sure\nHomestuck would be finished by now if I'd never used flash at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are other weird ways it factors in, like certain expectations it\ncreates. Once it gets in the readers' heads that it's a recurring device\nfor the story, they start to look out for it and expect it in certain\nsituations, compare static content with flash, consider how awesome some\nstatic panels would have been if done in flash or how awesome situation\nX will be if animated with song Y. The potential for disappointment\nlooms constantly with increased expectations. None of this is\nparticularly bad, but if you're the guy responsible for putting together\nthis story, you tend to be keenly aware of it, and it factors into the\nbig puzzle of managing it all. And a big part of that puzzle has been\nanswering the question \"to flash or not to flash?\" <br/>\n<br/>\nI've said before, the deeper into this I get, the less I feel like a\nwriter or artist, and more I'm like a producer, managing story decisions\nweighed carefully against cost of execution. And cost can mean a lot of\nthings. Effort needed, organizational complexity (usually most present\nin interactive pages), time delay or obstruction to story advancement,\nstuff like that. This kind of thing doesn't factor in if you're writing\nsomething more conventional, like a book. You write in exactly what\nserves the story, as you envision it. It may sound crazy that's not what\nI'm doing, but it really can't be anymore, not with these high octane\nanimations in the mix as part of the expected delivery. I have to think\nlike a producer to make that work. To understand what that means, here's\nan anecdote about Indiana Jones, which might not be quite true but\nwhatever, it's just something I'm vaguely remembering. When Spielberg\nwas going over the script with somebody, it called for a pit full of\nlions, and he said \"whoa! too expensive! let's go with snakes.\" So you\ngot Indy afraid of snakes instead of lions, because it turns out you can\nbuy crazy loads of snakes for bargain bux. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt would be really reasonable for him to be afraid of lions though. They\nare huge and hungry and fucking terrifying. Have you SEEN a lion???\nLions would be my quirky phobia if I was a rugged dude with a whip and\nlonging for treasure.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLions.<br/>\n<br/>\n(roar)<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did it have to be...<br/>\n<br/>\n(roar)<br/>\n<br/>\nLions. :(\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMay 19, 2011 - May 27, 2011\n\n</div>"

You've been quiet for a few days now.</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nMore technical problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nTOO BORING; DON'T READ.<br/>\n<br/>\nSeriously, don't read this. It's so boring.<br/>\n<br/>\nA couple weeks ago my computer broke so rather than go through the\nrigmarole of getting it back up and running I just bought another cheap\ncomputer and copied all my shit over to it to solve the problem as\nquickly and painlessly as possible so I could just keep working. That\nwent ok.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis as I said tends to be what I do when I run into technical problems\nrather than bang my head against the wall for days with diagnostics and\npart-swappings and repairs, and so I can just keep working and doing\nstuff that's actually important instead of dicking around with\nelectronics.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaybe it sounds wasteful but it isn't. I just use the old machine as a\nspare computer, after fixing it up GRADUALLY, at a leisurely pace, where\ndoing so will not present an obstacle to continuous work. So that's\nwhat I did. But in this case, I liked my old machine better than the new\none, so once it was fixed up and ready to go, I prepared to make a\nquick hop back over to old machine and keep the new one as a spare. <br/>\n<br/>\nExcept the hop wasn't quick, for one reason. Photoshop and Flash didn't\nwork after installation. (the whole CS3 suite, actually) Still not sure\nwhy. At this point I'm guessing the installation file got corrupted\nsomehow in all the shuffle. Of course the road to understanding you're\ndealing with a very serious problem is paved with all these excruciating\ndiagnostic measures, like uninstalling/reinstalling CS3 a dozen times\nand even reinstalling Windows a few times in 32 and 64 bit mode to make\nsure something like that isn't fucking up the works. Particularly\nmaddening since I JUST INSTALLED it on my new machine a couple weeks ago\nand it worked fine. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd this kind of shit is exactly why I don't fight with computers\nanymore, I just replace them. Except that policy is really difficult to\nput into play in a situation like this, where the software is at issue\nregardless of what machine you use. But actually, I did investigate this\napproach anyway. It's just a more bitter pill to swallow because Adobe\nCS5 (their latest, solely offered version) costs literally five times\nwhat my computer cost. So I thought, maybe that's ok, maybe this is a\ngood time to upgrade even if it's ridiculously expensive. So a good\nchunk of time I spent looking into CS5, downloading the trial and all.\nPhotoshop CS5 is a very nice program, pretty elegantly designed, but I\ndiscovered it has one hideous flaw that makes it practically unusable to\nme. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you use Photoshop, maybe you know about it. I'm getting the sense it bugs a lot\nof people. It's summarized here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110529123832/http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://forums.cgsociety.org/archive/index.php/t-899953.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nWhen I use Photoshop, generally I have 5 or 10 or even 20 documents open\nat all times. Actually, they're always open, even when I'm not using\nPS. This is how I work on Homestuck, I just have a ton of pertinent\nfiles open all the time so I don't have to spend as much time rooting\naround for stuff. Having all those files clog up the taskbar is moronic.\nThe \"tabbed documents\" system is just as moronic, for my process.\nTabbed web browsing is a brilliant innovation. Tabbed PS document\nnavigation, not so much, since many PS users like to be able to look at\nmore than one document at once, side by side. Not sure why the\ndevelopers thought they struck gold with this feature. <br/>\n<br/>\nI wouldn't give a shit about any of this if they just made these\nfeatures optional, and allowed CS3-like behavior to exist. And I might\neven make an attempt to get used to it, if Adobe wasn't asking for\nnearly $2000 for the suite (or $1700, for just Photoshop + Flash CS5).\nI'm not going to pay that kind of money on something that just makes me\nangry to use. Adobe seems to think I'll be delighted to whip out my\ncredit card for the privilege of a mandatory workflow overhaul. Think\nagain bros.<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually I just gave up on the CS5 idea, and after undergoing a whole\nlot more terribleness too boring to mention, I finally just got CS3\nworking again instead. So that's that dumb story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis was all pretty aggravating and exhausting, and kinda made me lose\nmy train of thought on the story. Piling this on top of other recent\ndisruptions like traveling and the preceding technical bullshit doesn't\nhelp much. Constant forward motion on the story tends to be what keeps\nthe thing living in my head, and I'm finding if you stack up enough\nmajor interruptions, it isn't just lost labor time that accounts for\ndelay, but disrupted inspiration, as I have to completely regroup on\nwhat the fuck I was even thinking before shit hit the fan. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it doesn't really help that it's a fairly delicate part of the story\nwhere the point is to wrap up a lot complex stuff in some kind of\nsensible way, rather than the typical mode of casual meandering, where\nwe could hop over to some funny conversation that isn't particularly\nimportant otherwise and I could just say, There, there is your content,\nenjoy. It's really the perfect storm of built up story complexity,\ncommitment to a methodical resolution of everything, radically\nrethinking long-planned points of execution (i.e. axing huge flash\nplans, figuring out how to structure/convey them statically), and a\ndisastrous series of technical disruptions. Updates just can't push\nthrough this any faster than they are right now.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMay 19, 2011 - May 27, 2011\n\n</div>"

It's hard to\nexpress how absurd this undertaking would be from my standpoint, and the\nstandpoint of good business practice.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am sorry the reality does not match your expectations. They would be\nreasonable expectations if Homestuck was a property of, say, Disney. And\nthe top Disney honcho could make a call to the guy in the Chinese\nfactory which Disney undoubtedly owns and say \"Hey, let's make a million\nof these.\" and have that operational agility, and ability to make it\ncost effective through outrageous volume. Unfortunately, Disney doesn't\nown Homestuck yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you see is the best possible shirt in the real world, but also\nby any standard I think.

If you accept a commission to draw a\nHomestuck character without my permission, does that mean I will file a\ncease and desist order? Or if you sell an HS sketch at a convention,\nwill I hunt you down, kick over your table, and then muss up your hair\nand stomp on your glasses?<br/>\n<br/>\nNo, that would be silly.<br/>\n<br/>\nI just clarified what the official position is, which is that you\nshouldn't attempt to profit from my work, or anyone else's for that\nmatter, unless you have permission. It's not that I'm suddenly outraged\npeople are doing HS commissions and stuff. I've previously taken an\nultra passive attitude to all this. But the result of that, as well as\nthe result in HS's growing popularity, has been a surging culture of\ncasual copyright violation, which though seemingly harmless case by\ncase, in totality is starting to look problematic. In particular, it\nseems to be leading to increasingly flagrant violations here and there,\nthings which are more serious than a simple commission, and which I\nwould be inclined to take measures to stop. It's easy to see how this\ntrend develops. Someone notices wave after wave of HS artwork being sold\nby others, and presumes it's ok to take it a little further. And then\nfurther...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think it's better to address this before it turns into a bigger\nproblem. Honestly, the theoretical money I am losing is not what is\nmotivating me here. When you do an HS commission, I can't really imagine\nhow that translates to dollars leaving my pocket, other than projecting\nlosses in the very big picture if stuff like that goes unchecked. It's\nmainly a little unsettling to watch so many people at once act so\ncasually about profiting off another's IP without asking, and even more\nunsettling to imagine it spiraling out of control. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt may be the case that a sketch of a Pokemon sold to your friend is an\nunenforceable violation, and Nintendo will never get involved, but it is\nstill technically a violation. Please understand the fact that it is\nunenforceable does not make it less of a violation. You have profited\nfrom Nintendo's property, without permission. Which is not to say there\nare not degrees of violation beyond this which are more flagrant, but we\nshould be clear about it. Knowing that, you might decide to do it\nanyway. Or you might decide to ask Nintendo permission. (They would say\nno. I might not, though.)<br/>\n<br/>\nRequiring you to ask permission isn't much of an imposition. But I\nhesitate to guarantee satisfaction even if you do, because for one\nthing, your email might slip through the cracks and I might not get back\nto you. It's happened before. I've had requests like this, and some\nI've responded to favorably, while others I didn't get around to\nreplying to. Which I feel bad about, as I generally feel bad I can't\nanswer all my mail, but that's how it goes. All I can say is, if you're\nwondering, ask. I may say yes. I may say no. I may not respond. If I\ndon't, then you may use your discretion, while understanding the\nposition I have taken. If you cross a line, there's a good chance you'll\nhear from me eventually. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd rather this not be about finding out exactly what I do or don't\nallow, and then just getting down to furiously attacking that wiggle\nroom I give. I'd rather it be about respect for the property of artists.\nEveryone who this affects is an artist as well, presumably. If you're\nan artist, you should care about this topic and evaluate your standards,\nbecause you are undoubtedly hoping others will respect your work and\nyour rights as well. Imagine you are at a convention, selling Pokemon\ndrawings or such. If you knew one of Nintendo's most aggressive lawyers\nwas lurking nearby, would you still do it? Is it fear of being\nprosecuted that motivates you to stop? Or is it the fact that you do not\nown Pokemon, and though it belongs to a multi billion dollar company\nthat won't feel the slightest hardship because of you, it doesn't seem\nright, because these aren't your creations? Or maybe it is less about\nrespect to the original creator, and more about taking pride in selling\nwhat you have created yourself, or at the very least, that which you\nhave been given the right to?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd if the idea of selling black market Pokemon stuff makes you feel\nuncomfortable, where the owner has millions of dollars applied to a\nlegal staff interested in crushing IP violations no matter how well\nintended, then why would you feel better about selling stuff owned by a\nguy without a tiny fraction of those resources, who has heretofore shown\nnot even the slightest interest in taking action against his\nenthusiastic fans? <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are things for you to think about, and then act according to your\ninternal compass on the matter. I am not going to TAKE YOU DOWN if you\nsell a sketch of a troll to a friend or whatever. I'm just letting you\nknow my position, and will be reasonably content to let the fans govern\nthemselves, unless certain lines are crossed. Then we will talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for the Formspring Question of the Day...<br/>\n<br/>\nEventually, before I die, I would like to somehow, some way, get my hands on that\ngod damn fucking tiger.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nMay 28, 2011 - June 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

It brought back a lot of the crazy\ninnovation and ingenuity that makes MSPA so mind-blowing. Was it\ninfluenced by Bard Quest at all? Is there any sort inspiration you look\nto when doing these unusual updates?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nNot Bard Quest necessarily, just taking advantage of the fact\nthat I built the site from the beginning to allow branching paths, even\nif they all wind up back at the same place. Every other story does this.\nBQ obviously, Jailbreak has one fork that converges again, and Problem\nsleuth uses a couple really quick offshoots to handle deaths and other\nfuck-ups.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from that, one of the main points of the Scratch segment was not\nonly to slip into a different gear with respect to story pacing, but to\nintroduce a vehicle to explore new methods for engaging with events in a\nstory which has accrued a vast amount of detail and complexity. The\nconsequence has been a little more detachment from the events directly\nas we experience some mediation between us and the characters through\nthis host. But what comes with that bit of extra distance from the\nstory, and bringing to fore its features as a work of metafiction, are\nthese devices for accessing this complex story which wouldn't make sense\nto introduce without letting this segment build some momentum.<br/>\n<br/>\nTelling the story in parallel through the header images was an example\nof that potential, and tying together the themes in the header with the\nmain content was one of the interesting challenges. And of course the\nnarrator himself is a character with a role in the story, so as he tells\nthe story he is advancing his own role in it as well. A lot more is\nbeing advanced at the same time, in a way that I think is fun and in the\nspirit of everything on the site. The scrapbook thing is another\nexample, a way of utilizing some of these silly meta-story devices which\nat first appear to be mocking the format itself, but become another\nuseful gateway into a bunch of different threads of the story at once.\nOf course you read those threads one at a time, but the feeling is that\nthey're being accessed in parallel. Using parallel story telling devices\nseemed like an interesting way to address what has become a formidable\nnumber of threads to keep track of, and also a fun way to give some\nforgotten details a little more attention which would seem like a pretty\nfrivolous diversion otherwise (like Nepeta talking to Jaspers), while\nstill finding a way to give them a little relevance to the current\nstorylines. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn a way the Scratch segment has been like busting open a pinata of\ndifferent storytelling devices and seeing what's there to work with. And\nhe sort of did that literally when he broke the scrapbook over Slick's\nhead, releasing all the clippings from the story, both old and new.\nHaving them strewn about the place is another semi-mocking\nacknowledgement of the nature of the story, a thing which has dissolved\ninto absolute nonlinearity, where looking into a panel at any point in\ntime, past present or future, reality memory dream or afterlife, is\nsomething which can advance the plot. Because it advances not just\nthrough unfolding action, but by what previously concealed information\nis exposed, and how it's presented. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis was actually one of the reasons for devising the dream bubble\nsystem. It serves a purpose in the plot, yes, but it also has flexible\nnarrative utility. The dream bubbles allow moments of the past to be\nexplored, or moments of an alternate timeline, through memories of\ncharacters in such a way that it doesn't have to be a strict flashback,\ncan be invested with more immediate relevance to what's going on, and\nallows a way for characters to talk about it. (Remember, rules for when\ndialogue is allowed are pretty strict! Dream bubbles amended the rules\nsuch that characters can converse directly when dreaming or dead. This\nis because the segments begin as memories consisting of online\nconversations, and continue from there.) It was a more effective way to\nconvey Cal's final journey and Scratch's origin, for instance. And it\nagain becomes a useful tool when examining a clipping on the floor of an\nobscure event in the past. We enter the panel somewhat like the\ncharacters do, seeing it as a memory of something that's already\nhappened, but the scene evolves as the characters remember, and soon\nthrough their interaction it catches up with the current state of the\nstory and contributes to it. Other clippings are played a little more\nstraight, like we are briefly entering a window to another parallel\nevent, then moving on. Either way, going into his clippings momentarily\nreconnects us directly with the story rather than experiencing it\nthrough his mediation. But then, the mediation allowed us to do this in\nthe first place. There'll probably be a few more of these scrapbook\ngateways before we're done with them.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJuly 2, 2011 - July 8, 2011\n\n</div>"

The events were conveyed visually\nand verbally to suit the Scratch narration, instead of shown through\nhigh-intensity animated visuals alone. The Scratch segment was not\nintroduced as a substitute for the animation. An \"abridged\" stretch like\nthis was going to come anyway as a device for setting a few things up\nbefore starting on the EOA animation. Axing the Rose v. Jack / Vriska v.\nJack animation (aka Heroes of Light: Strife) just meant moving Scratch\nthe segment up sooner, to use as a vehicle for delivering the full flash\nconcept without having to scrap it as a story direction, which would\nhave been a pretty significant architectural upheaval. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow that it's out there, we can examine the pros and cons of delivering\nit that way as opposed to flash. (But note, no matter what, there was no\nchance of that flash getting made whatsoever. This is really not about\n\"what could have been\")<br/>\n<br/>\nPros of flash:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Would have been WAY MORE RADICAL (frankly I don't care much about\nthis. the rad quotient of preceding flash material is already pretty\nhigh, and there's plenty more combustible shit to come)<br/>\n<br/>\n- The idea as a whole would have been delivered in minutes, rather than\nweeks, giving people the full sense of the story development all at\nonce, and limiting the drag on the serial readers' experience, and\ncorresponding vocalization of those frustrations (would have been BY FAR\nthe biggest advantage of flash)<br/>\n<br/>\nCons:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Concept as a whole may have been a bit challenging to parse with\nvisuals alone. The two parallel battles are easy enough to understand,\nbut I can easily imagine confusion over the alternate timeline concept\nas conveyed only visually. People have been confused by less. Much, much\nless.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Difficulty factor. Even with art contributors. There's a limit to not\nonly what I can do personally, but what a largely unstructured volunteer\neffort can accomplish as well. <br/>\n<br/>\n- Hiatus-induced suicide pact among readership.<br/>\n<br/>\nPros of narration:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Get to experiment with a little parallel storytelling, via the top banner. (pretty\nbig plus, IMO!)<br/>\n<br/>\n- Having it narrated removes ambiguity about a fairly cerebral chain of\nevents, while allowing the chance to indirectly develop Scratch's\ninvolvement in the story a bit.<br/>\n<br/>\n- I get to take my time with it and pretend to function like a normal human being\nfor a little while.<br/>\n<br/>\nCons: <br/>\n<br/>\n- Slow rolling the segment page by page has serial readers agonizing\nevery step of the way over every conceivable issue, on points of\nexecution, unwelcome \"story developments\", and so on. Once again,\nHomestuck is RUINED FOREVER! Until it isn't, of course.<br/>\n<br/>\n- If you're not into Scratch as a character or don't like his tone or\nthe whole omniscient smartass thing, then you probably aren't digging\nthe arc much. Not much to say about this. It's just a \"you like it or\nyou don't\" kind of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Altering the flow of the story always carries the risk of agitating\nsome readers. Not only because mixing shit up = automatic complaints\n(which is definitely true), but because by accelerating the pace to make\nbroader narrative strokes, you are inviting the usual objections\nfixated on showing vs. telling. But I think there are some legitimate\ngears of storytelling which involve showing by way of telling outright,\nas long as the reader has the patience to see it through to its\nconclusion (problematic serially, as usual). It's a gear in which bigger\nstory chunks that normally are given strong magnification (like a\ndeath) are told more compactly and in succession. These bigger chunks,\nwhen stacked up, \"show\", or more appropriately \"reveal\" an even bigger\nidea which is at the true heart of that narrative stretch. It's not the\nevent which the reader momentarily feels \"should\" expand to fill the\nstage, like a death. The death that with hindsight functions as a\nbuilding block of a more complete idea which more effectively serves the\nstory as a whole, completing unfinished arcs, building on the themes\nand such.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can look at story pacing like rolling a Katamari ball, with respect\nto the granularity of what has focus. At the beginning of HS, I'm\nrolling it around and picking up nickels and buttons. That's when John\nmessing around with cakes and such has focus as actual plot points. The\nball keeps rolling until points like that are too marginal to zoom in\non, and he's exploring a mysterious oily land killing monsters and stuff\nwhile we gloss over a lot of detail that in an earlier mode would have\nreceived intense scrutiny. We are picking up things like traffic cones\nand bicycles with our katamari ball, while still sculpting a shape that\nas a whole resembles a story. Hivebent was rolled with even bigger\ndenominations, maybe cars and trucks, gobbling up even bigger chunks\nlike buildings by the end of the arc, as Aradia was offhandedly\nmentioning how they killed the king and created a universe. With\nhindsight we see why, understanding the overall purpose that arc had for\nthe story, and how that particular pacing supported that purpose.\nUnlike Katamari though, the ball does get smaller sometimes, to go back\nto accommodating certain levels of detail like conversations and game\nmechanics, but it never dials all the way back. Doc has rolled with some\nof the biggest chunks yet, like buildings or mountains, casually\ndropping the deaths of characters as atomic features of his narration.\nHe clearly rolls the ball smaller at times too, when he wants. But this\nconstruction too has purpose, which needs some patience to watch it take\nshape and then hindsight to fully appreciate.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd like I've suggested before, these can be pretty disastrous\nconditions for the serial intake of a story. But honestly, there is no\nother way to do it. To strive to satisfy serial readers all the time is\nto do nothing but make something terrible in the long run. It means you\ncan't do much to set up anything sophisticated with deferred payoff, as\nyou perpetually submit what will immediately gratify. I can't tell\npeople that reading serially is the \"wrong\" way to read it, because this\nis not true. But there's no escaping the fact that having pages leaked\nout so slowly radically warps your perception of what is happening,\nsometimes for the better (community discussion, noticing details etc),\nbut often aggravates (arc fatigue, rushing to judgment...) Try to\nimagine watching your favorite movie, for the first time ever, but only a\nminute at a time, every day. Sound frustrating? How often do you think\nyou might get irritated with the director for his pacing decisions? Or\nhis \"plot twists\", which are really just the products of scenes cut\nshort before fully paying off? How often do you think you might want to\ninsist he move it along? What about reading your favorite book, but only\nreceiving about a paragraph or two every day? And what if the\nauthor/director was tuned into the responses to this daily output? Is\nthere anything he could do to outrun the impatience of the reader for\nplot points he's carefully set up to be evaluated in the minute-space of\narchival read-through, which the reader labors over in the month-space\nof serial digestion? Can he do anything to deflect or mitigate their\nrush to judgment of incomplete arcs? Should he? Probably not. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe pages spanning the two links above provide a pretty good example of\nhow serial intake messes with perception, and of why authors tend to\nlike to finish books before showing them to you. Now that it's all\nthere, let's look at the reasonable serial reactions to some key\nmoments, and compare to the reality in hindsight.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Terezi flips coin, Vriska flies away.<br/>\n<br/>\nSerial reaction: augh, anticlimax!!! All that build up, the stair\nclimbing and show downing and coin flipping... where's the battle?\nWhere's........ SOMETHING?<br/>\n<br/>\nReality: This was only the beginning of a deferred resolution to the\nongoing Terezi/Vriska rivalry. The resolution was actually the full\nsweep of this series of events in totality, resulting in Terezi looking\ninto the doomed timeline to find the rationale and the courage to kill\nVriska, which she finally did. All that buildup was not for that\none-page deflation, but this full sequence. Reservation of judgment was\nrequired, something that is much easier to practice when there are more\npages to click on.<br/>\n<br/>\n.....<br/>\n<br/>\nI could go on but I just realized I'm tired of typing. But really, the\nlist goes on and on like this throughout the whole story. Things which\ncome off as odd or vaguely unsatisfying or even JUST SO TERRIBLE in the\nshort term, but make sense and work better overall in the big picture.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou could complete this exercise yourself if you felt like it. Look at\nan event, remember how you felt on reading it live, and now how you view\nit in retrospect. Or, for extra credit, imagine you could wipe your\nmemory of the past several months of content, and pretend I just posted\nit all today. What would your reaction be? How does it read? Do the\nissues which seemed to loom so large in the moment, like the omnipresent\n\"get on with it\" factor, even cross your mind for a second during such\nan archival dump? And for extra extra credit, imagine wiping your memory\nof all of Homestuck, and I just dropped it all in your lap right now\nwhile you were idling musing what sort of thing I might work on after\nProblem Sleuth. What do you think? Of it in totality, and of recent\nevents? What is there that wears thin, on its own terms of pacing,\nrather than that dictated by two years of attrition on one's ability to\nremain completely engaged and cognizant of all relevant threads?<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is a lot to think about when you make a story. Not just in how to\nmake it, but in how it is absorbed. One story is really two completely\ndifferent stories. The one that is read all at once, and the one that is\nread over your shoulder while you make it.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJune 10, 2011 - July 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

He then likes to put out the fire when he arrives, so that\nmore copies of him from other points in time don't show up and make\nthings complicated. Unless he wants to exploit that for battle purposes,\nwhich he clearly didn't. Scratch keeps a fire alarm in his apartment to\nsummon him, in case it catches fire, which it clearly did.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuarters (14) has a collection of coins like the one Clover flipped.\nEach has numbers on either side, corresponding to a member of the Felt,\nmost separated by 10, with a few exceptions. i.e.<br/>\n<br/>\n1, 11<br/>\n2, 12<br/>\n3, 13<br/>\n4, 14<br/>\n5, 15<br/>\n6, 9<br/>\n7, 10<br/>\n8, 8<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen you flip the coin, it summons the member whose number is face up,\nfrom some place in space and time. If the opposite member is present\nduring the flip, he trades places with that member, which is why Clover\nswapped for Quarters when he flipped 14.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you flip your own coin, and the result is your own number, you die.\nAs such, Quarters entrusts his own coin with Clover, who is so lucky, he\nwill never flip a 4. He uses it to summon Quarters when things get too\nhot to handle. It's not advisable to let Snowman flip her own coin.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe coins link pairs of Felt members. Some are relevant pairings, others\ndon't make much sense. Die and Stitch have a similar power, with their\ndestructive/healing voodoo doll and effigies. Doze and Eggs make a pair\nof morons with a funny duo name (dozen eggs!) Itchy runs around so fast\nhe probably starts fires sometimes, while Matchsticks puts them out.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJune 12, 2011 - July 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

Not that I am withholding it\nto be coy, but to take my word for it one way or another would be\nmissing the point. The destruction of the clock is another element among\nmany for you to weigh when considering these events.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, there's the consideration of whether her death was just, heroic,\nor neither. The clock appeared to be leaning toward \"just\", when it was\ninterrupted by the crowbar. Maybe it would have landed there. Or if\ngiven the chance, maybe it would have swung back and settled somewhere\nelse. We don't have a definitive ruling. All we know for sure is she's\ndead.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo we can conclude that either: <br/>\n<br/>\n1) The clock itself has no bearing on her life directly, much as clocks\nmerely measure time without influencing it. Which would mean if given\nthe chance it definitely would have landed on either just or heroic, but\nnot in the middle. The proof is her death.<br/>\n<br/>\nor <br/>\n<br/>\n2) The result of the clock does have direct bearing on her life, and by\nknocking the clock over so that it stuck on \"just\", Slick inadvertently\nkilled her for good, regardless of where it may have landed. But to be\nfair, if he knew it was going to kill her, he might be hitting it\nharder. You could consider it delayed revenge for his exile, which\nVriska and Snowman coordinated. It's safe to assume Slick would have\nfound her death to be quite just, and may have been weighing in on the\nmatter through circumstantial serendipity.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf 2) is true, there is another wrinkle to consider. Recall that the\ncrowbar he is using (from the intermission) has the property of being\nable to nullify the effect of whatever \"enchanted\" object it destroys.\nIf the clock's power is to decide whether she resurrects, then by\ndestroying it, he eliminates that power. Since there's no longer a force\nenabling her to resurrect, she remains dead. This is another way to\nlook at it, but again, only if the clock itself has that power over her\nlife.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf not, then the destruction of the clock becomes more a violent gesture\nof punctuation to accompany this \"divine ruling\", like nails being\ndriven into a coffin. Or, like a tolling bell. It's jarring, sudden, and\ncarries finality.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are convinced her actions are what decided her death, and not the\ndestruction of the clock, then you are left to consider what outcome is\nmost suitable, without having an absolute ruling on it. The clock did\nappear to lean \"just\" an instant before, and there are plenty of ways to\nargue in favor of a just death. There are many mitigating factors as\nwell to supply a counter argument. It would not be that interesting if\nit were absolutely unambiguous, where everyone could all easily agree\nthat her death was just. Or if everyone agreed there was no justice in\nit at all. There are enough factors in play where you have reason to\nthink about it a bit, and such that it leaves plenty to discuss. You may\nconsider the evidence and draw a conclusion. You may even feel very\nstrongly about your conclusion! But for either the story, or me, to\nprovide a categorically \"right answer\", immediately following the\nestablishment of all the things that made it interesting to consider,\nshortchanges all that, I believe. For the clock to settle\nunceremoniously on \"just\" I feel would come across as a nonconstructive,\ncompact ethical lecture, quickly nullifying all there was to evaluate\nand talk about.<br/>\n<br/>\nWas this comeuppance for all her past killing? For killing friends like\nAradia and Tavros? Was there mitigation in her upbringing? In her\nremorse, and desire to change? Was it justice for insisting on playing a\nrole in the creation of Jack so that she could beat him, to serve her\nego? What of the ignored warning from Terezi? Flying off in spite of it,\nendangering them all, again in service of ego? What of the doomed\ntimeline she creates by doing this? Is there justice alone in killing\nher to prevent not only the death of all her friends, but an offshoot\nreality that can only fail? Is human morality in play here? Troll\nmorality?? Or is it a higher agency, like that permeating Skaia? In a\nframework of Skaian morality, is there justice in sacrificing one life\nto help ensure the creation of an entire universe? This paragraph has\nbeen a thumbnail sketch of all the discussion which has already taken\nplace across the internet, minus all the notes ranging from fan fervor\nto outright dementia. <br/>\n<br/>\nOf all the arguments to make, it's difficult to come up with a solid\nrationale for a heroic result. Most people debating it would choose\nbetween \"just\" or \"not just\", i.e. die or live. Note that this means\nthose who believe her death was not just are in fact arguing that the\ndestruction of the clock is actually what killed her!!! There is nothing\nin the story which rules this out.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, the result is the same. She's dead. Out of the story for\ngood? Who knows. For now it's the culmination of a wide arc importing\nelements from classic tragedy. Blind seers, wanton hubris, unheeded\nwarnings, regret and death. But with some MSPA twists. Systematized\nmortality conditions, doomed timeline offshoots, way too much dramatic\nirony, and Nic Cage.<br/>\n<br/>\nShe was always a polarizing character. Shouldn't be too surprising she's\nmore polarizing than ever in death. It's almost as if that polarity was\ngiven concrete expression through the rules dictating whether she lived\nor died.<br/>\n<br/>\nHM.<br/>\n<br/>\n:::;)\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded to <span class=\"user\">couchdenizen</span>,\n\nJune 16, 2011 - July 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

It may provoke the feeling that output is slowing\ndown, or grinding to a halt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not actually true though. After the 6 day pause, 41 pages were\nposted. That's about 7 pages per day, which is higher than the site's\nlifetime average of 5 pages per day. It's actually a hot streak!\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJuly 2 - July 9, 2011\n\n</div>"

        "html": "<div class=\"question-container\"><h2><a href=\"/formspring/question217252871568130030\">Are\nthese latest comics slower to get done because of the text-heavy nature\nof them, or is it just real life needing tending to? Not complaining\nabout the pacing, just curious.</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nThe page rate is deceptively slow when you zoom in on a select\nfew days. There was a 6 day pause, then 13 pages went up. So that's\nabout 2 pages per day, which is \"slow\", right? But then you wait a few\nmore days, and 23 pages have stacked up, and suddenly that rate jumps to\n4 pages per day, which is close to the site average. And if you examine\nthe period between now and 10 days ago, the rate is almost 8 pages per\nday, which is way above average. It's better to think of the output in\nlonger term averages. This is harder for those who demand regularity and\npredictability, which is something you get from some comics which\nupdate once every weekday, or m/w/f, without fail as part of their\nproduct delivery pledge. In these cases, the regularity of the output\nstrikes me as being almost as important, and sometimes more important,\nthan the quality of the content itself. This is because people are\ncreatures of habit, and have a strong craving for reliability. Many will\nquite happily absorb work they consider to be fairly mediocre as long\nas it is cranked out like clockwork. The sunday funnies is probably a\ngood long term example of this. Millions of people gobbled up decades of\nMarmaduke without ever laughing once, but editors wouldn't dare fuck\nwith Marmaduke because people needed that shit with their coffee for\nsome reason. You could put a gun to their head and they couldn't tell\nyou why. There is comfort in even bland routine. If you mess with\npeople's comfort and destabilize certain regularities in their universe,\nthey become agitated, even angry. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if people actually have any sort of passion for the entertainment\ncomprising their routine, then they become even more agitated if the\noutput is disturbed. Passionate interest severely exacerbates the\nsituation, and can make a creator envy someone like Marmaduke Guy who\nspent his career crouching safely in mediocrity, grinding out awful dog\ncomics everyone became totally comfortable with disliking. (I bet he\nnever got an angry letter from an anime fan.) But if you mess with the\nschedule of material that people zealously crave, they are not merely\nirked, but can receive it as a personal affront from the author. This is\ntrue in varying degrees for probably most enthusiastic readers, but is\nmore pronounced by the degree to which a person is mentally ill. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are some particularly unpleasant entities out there who pose\nquestions similar to yours, but much less politely. These are seemingly\nself appointed watchdogs for my page rate, and I think I'm safe in\nassuming most are severely under-medicated teens with a bigtime beef\nabout You Fucking Name It. As torrid a pace as Homestuck has been\nunloaded on the public, I think it must have been pretty easy for some\nspoiled children to factor that rate of output into the entitlement\ncomplex which presides over their central nervous systems. Deviation\nfrom that production schedule in the minds of the entitled means nothing\nother than offense committed by the author, or more generously, just a\nstaggering display of laziness. Never mind that the alleged deviation\nmay not even QUITE exist (see numbers in first paragraph). But if it\ndid, I wonder whose rate of production they would compare it to, aside\nfrom some foggy recollection of my own? <br/>\n<br/>\nFor such people, what would probably be useful would be a dose of\nperspective. Not that they're likely to read this, but let's consider\nthe following data anyway, kindly provided by tvtropes.com.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a class=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicsLongRunners\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicsLongRunners</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMSPA is the longest web comic on record, in terms of update quantity. It\naccumulated most of this content in about 3 years. Now consider that\nthe second comic on the list is approximately THE OLDEST WEB COMIC IN\nEXISTENCE. It dates back to 1995, which for all intents and purposes was\nthe year the internet was born. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere are of course some mitigating factors. Most MSPA updates are a\nsingle panel, with some accompanying text. But there are some\ncounter-caveats which make this a bit more difficult to process. There\nare several hours of animated Flash footage mixed in with the updates.\nThere are several more hours of interactive gameplay. Each Flash\ninstance occupies a single update. Many updates are accompanied by\nseveral pages of dialogue. Some of these individual conversations would\ntake up 50 pages worth of speech bubbles in a graphic novel. The total\nword count for MSPA likely exceeds most of the comics on that list, or\npossibly all of them. It wouldn't be surprising. Homestuck alone is over\n300K words. Again, this effort was compressed into the last 3 years,\nwhile most of the other comics date back to the 90's.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat does this mean? Here is what it means.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's imagine MSPA was distributed more like a \"normal comic\". Where,\neven with a healthy update schedule of 7 days a week, you still only get\none new thing to click on. One update per day. It could be a simple\npanel with a silly gag and no text. Could be a panel with 10 pages of\ndialogue beneath it. Or it could be a 3 minute flash animation. All are\nthings that appear in the archive in good supply. Distributing one such\nthing per day, as the designated \"product\", would be a completely\nreasonable policy. If that were the established pattern from the start,\nnobody would think it was remotely inappropriate, and nobody would ask\nfor more, in the same way that nobody ever demands that Penny Arcade\nupdate 7 days a week instead of 3.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf that were the case, MSPA would now have 16 years worth of content. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what does THIS mean??<br/>\n<br/>\nIt means, given that I started 3 years ago, I could take a 13 year break\nstarting now, and at the end of that break, MSPA's lifetime rate of\nproduction would still manage to make the lifetime rate of most other\ncomics seem underwhelming. This is literally, actually true, even though\nit sounds like a joke. There is statistical evidence to support this,\nusing the only data that matters, which is the existing work of peers in\nthe same field.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo if some twerp who's never put a stretch of hard work into anything\naside from grinding for levels in WoW all weekend decides to get on my\ncase about slowing down, I think I'll just start whispering \"13 year\nbreak...\"<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n13 year break.........<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n13 year break............................<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n13<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nyear<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nbreak.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. I wonder how many frowns this question would get if you could frown at\nthings?<br/>\n<br/>\nP.P.S. smile @ this question if you don't like idea of 13 year break :) :) :) :) :)\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nJuly 18, 2011\n\n</div>"

This means lower classes must be much more copious than higher\nclasses. The lowbloods die off much more quickly, and so must be spawned\nin greater numbers.

Turning Terezi against\nVriska was likely the only way he could kill Vriska, due to her cerebral\n\"luck neutralizing\" ability. Did he exaggerate Karkat's fears to\ndestabilize the team?

Whether the Sufferer's name is actually Jegus, and whether or\nnot she actually knew anything about this story when she said that, is\nleft to your speculation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis ancestor interlude is a little religious tale. Over the course of\nthe story sometimes we wander into these silly mini-genres, like\n\"horrorstuck\", or erotic historical fiction through Mindfang's journal\nentries. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jesus parallel is pretty blatant, down to the use of the torture\ndevice as the symbol for the religious movement (cross, irons). I\npersonally think the explanation of the relevance of Karkat's sign is\none of the more interesting aspects about it, just from the perspective\nof taking existing symbols and adapting them to an evolving mythological\nframework. Segments like this aren't really just about \"Gee, the\nancestors sure are cool, let's hear more about them.\" (Though there's no\nquestion there's a certain amount of fan service in play when I do\nstuff like this.) We learn more about the story and characters and\nanswer questions beyond the limited scope of their biographies, like why\nKarkat had a sign at all if he had no caste.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe learn more about the troll race, as a once peaceful species and such\nbefore kid-ancestors as players scratched their session, though the\nshort term relevance of this is mainly as a preamble to Scratch's\nreligious story. Establishing an Eden-like paradise from which there is\nsome departure through sin is sort of the boilerplate basis for\nreligious lore. <br/>\n<br/>\nScratch is a devil figure about as blatant as the Sufferer is a Christ\nfigure. The failed players from peaceful Alternia made a classic \"deal\nwith the devil\" move by causing the scratch after being given a choice\nby the mother of all monsters. (Echidna. Hey, she's a big snake!) By\ndoing so they brought Scratch into their universe, and therefore all the\nthings you'd expect that comes with summoning the devil. This resulted\nnot only turning Alternia into a planet full of violent murderers, but\nit only technically granted them what they wanted with a huge caveat, as\nis the case with such ill-advised bargains. The players were strong\nenough to win, but made a terminal universe, were barred from entry,\nhunted by a demon, and then started killing each other. <br/>\n<br/>\n\"Old Scratch\" is actually an old timey nickname for the devil. It's used\nin some Twain books. The manipulative devil figure pulling the strings\nwas always the basis for his character, and this was probably pretty\nobvious right away. He's part devil/puppet/cueball, with a dash of the\nold gambler/gunslinger Doc Holliday in his profile. Doc Holliday is\nactually my ancestor. He is related to me on my mother's side, who's\nlast name is also Holliday.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully I won't die at age 36 of tuberculosis though. If there's\nanything to the karmic fortune-swapping of the trolls and their\nancestors, ideally tuberculosis will die of me.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nFriday, August 12, 2011 11:02 PM\n\n</div>"

If you are, 1) that is amazing and 2) how do you\nplan to handle flash animations?</a></h2></div><div class=\"response-container\"><p>\nYes, I'm working on it now, among other things. It's nice to hear you like the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe flash stuff will be handled in a way that graphic novels have been\neffectively conveying dramatic action for a long time. Through\nsequential art.<br/>\n<br/>\nA number of people seem to have trouble with the concept of a book\nadaptation, almost to the point where the idea of the object existing\nsomewhere in reality offends them. It seems some would prefer it not\nexist at all, even if it means denying it from those who really want a\nbook adaptation despite the obvious cross-media challenges. If we were\nall supremely literal people by equal measure, we would all demand a DVD\ntreatment or something similar, with all the music and animation intact\nas it is on the web. However, some people like books. They like a\nphysical, tactile object that you can take off a shelf, flip through and\nread, without turning something on or glaring at a screen for hours.\nThis is why books still exist, and why we haven't decided to burn down\nour libraries quite yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking such strong issue with adaptation from one form of media to\nanother is puzzling to me. It happens all the time. Books are adapted to\nmovies, and back. Musicals become films, films become games, games\nbecome comics. Stories have many ways they can be told. If someone were\ngoing to make a graphic novel out of a movie, imagine how absurd it\nwould be to ask the artist, \"Oh yeah? How are you going to handle all\nthe moving around bits? Like, all that motion that happens in movies?\nOh, what about the MUSIC??\" The objection is actually profoundly\nidiotic, but we don't actually hear people raise such qualms with these\nsorts of adaptations, probably because they are known quantities. We\nknow what a book-to-film adaptation is like. It's a Thing. Bringing\nHomestuck into static media is not a Thing, because I essentially\ninvented the original format. This probably messes with people's heads\non the issue somewhat. <br/>\n<br/>\nI guess part of it is that craving absolute purity and fidelity from an\nadaptation is a hallmark of the zealously devoted. That's fine, but\nisn't really a point of view I cotton to. It's very rigid, very linear,\nand those demands are ironically antithetical to the spirit behind HS's\ncreation, and all those crazy things that allegedly won't cross over to\nprint. So you say HS \"absolutely cannot exist in a book?\" If I had much\nconcern for what a story absolutely could or couldn't be, I wouldn't\nhave even made it in the first place. Imagine again a movie with all its\nmotion and sound becoming a graphic novel, and how reasonable this\nendeavor is. What if the hyper-zealous nerd has concerns that the novel\nwon't be able to capture all of this FEELING and EMOTION from the scenes\nthat the pacing and sound evoked through perfect, literal duplication\nin print? Well, it won't. It's not supposed to, and it's a completely\nunreasonable expectation to have for the adaptation. It will be a\ndifferent angle on the work, and that's fine. It's great, in fact. It\nshould be what you want from an adaptation. If you want to re-experience\nexactly what you felt in its original form, then you may go enjoy it in\nits original form again. That's why it's there.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe funny thing is, all the types of adaptations I mentioned, like\nbook-to-film, are very major departures in format. A Homestuck book\nactually comes quite close to representing the original work by\ncomparison, because after all, HS is at least 95% mostly-static panels,\nwith text underneath. Anyone who says that's outrageously unfit for\nprint is being quite extreme. As a whole, the thing is basically a great\nbig comic. A comic with a few perks the web affords.\n</p></div><div class=\"meta\"><span class=\"user\">mspadventures</span>\nresponded\n\nSunday, August 28, 2011 4:49 AM\n\n</div>"

First thing\n                     you should know, as of right now the hosting solution isn’t even a sure thing.\n                  </p>\n<p>I have something lined up, but haven’t heard from the guy helping me out in a few days. So I’m\n                     not sure about the timing on this. I can’t go into more details on the solution than that\n                     yet.\n                  </p>\n<p>I’ve heard many alternative suggestions and will probably continue to. To field a few of\n                     them:\n                  </p>\n<p>1) I’m not going to host it on youtube. Or render it in video format at all. I don’t want\n                     it to be a video. I want it to be Flash. If I thought I was going to end up rendering a video, I\n                     would have planned the project for video output accordingly. Perhaps used After Effects. It’s\n                     a completely different kind of media. This option is not going to happen.\n                  </p>\n<p>2) You may “know a guy” with hosting to spare, or such. While it’s a nice thought,\n                     there’s a 99.99% chance his server can’t handle it. It’s a big file, and there’ll\n                     be upwards of 2 million people looking at it at once. This will use more bandwidth in one day than\n                     most high traffic comics use in a year. Sorry, but thanks for the offer.\n                  </p>\n<p>3) Amazon S3, etc? I’ve looked into a bunch of things like this. It’s expensive. Under\n                     usual circumstances, it costs several thousand dollars every month to host MSPA. And I’m fine\n                     with floating that cost myself, from ad revenue and sales, and making the business side of things\n                     work to sustain it. This is a little different. A conservative estimate has the cost at $10K for one\n                     day. This is not considering excessive page reloads, the aftershocks of hosting it for the following\n                     weeks, or an unanticipated viral explosion beyond the already high expected traffic. Could be\n                     anywhere from $10K to $100K to host this one stupid file, which is bankruptcy territory. It’s\n                     not worth that to put out a little free entertainment, frankly. If I posted that kind of content for\n                     such an audience every month, I’d find some business strategy to make that work. But I’m\n                     not there yet. Also, I’m not gonna do some sort of fund drive to finance this either. I’m\n                     sure that would produce some results, but it just doesn’t sit well with me as the answer.\n                  </p>\n<p>So I’m working on more creative alternatives for handling this. I’ll let you know.</p>\n<p>edit: Torrenting, megadownloading, etc are in reserve as last resort plans. It would be more ideal to\n                     find a way to run on site though.

      "html": "\n<div class=\"title\">About EOA5, part 1</div>\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>First, I’ll go into the process, and all the technical stuff about making it. It ended up being\n                     around 13 and a half minutes, about 50 MB, was split up into 5 separate Flash files strung\n                     together by a loader, and used around a thousand art assets, not counting those imported from old\n                     animations. Following about a 2 week break starting 8/22 to take care of other things, I started\n                     more serious work on it, and took about 6 weeks to finish it.\n                  </p>\n<p>\n<!-- more -->It was more than 3 times as long as Descend (the end of act 4) which was previously the\n                     longest animation. But it took about six times as long to make! So, why so long? Let’s look at\n                     some reasons.\n                  </p>\n<p>1) COLLABORATION OVERLOAD! - First of all, I think all the contributed art is amazing, and I’m\n                     ecstatic with the overall look of the integrated results. But as strange and unintuitive as it\n                     sounds, getting so many people to pitch in to such a big project actually delayed the process\n                     non-trivially. I didn’t really anticipate the challenges of managing a project of this size. I\n                     spent a lot of time up front planning, organizing, dividing things up into tasks, and communicating\n                     with many artists individually. This is overhead that is normally negligible for smaller projects,\n                     where I usually just charge right in and begin animating. Then, after distributing the work, there’s\n                     the inevitable waiting game, while assets started coming back to me in pretty much random order,\n                     which makes for a scheduling conundrum. There is also the need to process the graphics to be\n                     suitable for animation, make little fixes and touches, or sometimes redo graphics completely if I\n                     didn’t quite convey the requirements properly. None of this is in play when I work solo. I\n                     generally draw fast, know exactly what’s necessary for the Flash, take just the right\n                     shortcuts on graphics, format them right from the getgo, and drop them on the timeline. But on the\n                     flipside, the contributors generally can take the time to render lovely backdrops and character\n                     portraits that I wouldn’t bother with on my own, for the sake of speed. This is a big plus I\n                     think.\n                  </p>\n<p>So the bottom line is, distributing work for a project of this size will cause the project to a) look\n                     better, but b) take longer. That said, looking back, I don’t think I would change anything\n                     about the approach. It looks great, and the time it took overall was worth it. I’d only revise\n                     my scheduling estimates.\n                  </p>\n<p>2) FLASH SUCKS! - Flash is not good at handling big animations. At all. I tried doing what I usually\n                     do, putting everything in one file, and hoping for the best. After about 7 minutes of completed\n                     animation, it started locking up constantly. I tried a lot of things, splitting it up into different\n                     scenes within the same file. Didn’t work. The Flash file ultimately caved in on itself, and\n                     became corrupted. Luckily I saved backups, and tried a different approach.\n                  </p>\n<p>I just split it up into five different Flash files, published them separately, and strung them all\n                     together through a loader file, which worked, but invited its own series of debugging headaches.\n                     After half way through the animation, I was CONSTANTLY putting out technical fires with respect to\n                     Flash. I’d say I probably lost two weeks to problems like this, which have been a total non\n                     factor in previous projects, aside from the first few when I was actually learning how to use\n                     it.\n                  </p>\n<p>The good news is I won’t repeat these mistakes in the future, and will know how to approach a\n                     project of this size more efficiently. The good-slash-bad news is this shouldn’t be an issue.\n                     I don’t see myself doing another animation this long for the rest of the series. Not even\n                     close, in fact. This was, in terms of cinematic gravitas, the high point of the series. It’s\n                     the conclusion to act five which all the setup demanded. It is the BIG ONE. A challenge I set out to\n                     do, for as much as any other reason, to see if I could.\n                  </p>\n<p>ABOUT MUSIC</p>\n<p>I decided to use Tensei’s “Cascade” as the theme around which the EOA5 score would\n                     be arranged a long time ago. Before he even made his <a href=\"/music/album/strife\" target=\"_blank\">solo album</a>,\n                     actually. I stuck with that idea through most of act 5.2. In fact, it exists in the first 1/3 of the\n                     score largely unedited. There were a few alterations for the sake of keying to specific visuals,\n                     like a significantly extended part, and the end was truncated to move on to the next theme. (I\n                     believe the original is a bonus song in <a href=\"/music/album/homestuck-vol-8\" target=\"_blank\">Volume 8</a>)\n                  </p>\n<p>All the editing was done by Toby Fox, who I worked closely with on piecing together the whole score,\n                     which adhered to a strict timetable of visual events. I gave him duration figures, cited timestamps\n                     on clips, and so on, and he worked with my mad instructions to craft something that functions very\n                     well as a score to the events I had in mind. This is the opposite of how it usually works. Usually I\n                     take a song that’s ready to go, and animate events to that song. Obviously there was no 13\n                     minute song lying around, so some custom work had to be done. This was done, most speedily, in the\n                     form of an extended medley, drifting in and out of different themes to suit the current action. Sort\n                     of like an expanded expression of the EOA’s predecessor, <a href=\"/music/track/descend\" target=\"_blank\">Descend</a>, which\n                     was Toby’s composition I adapted for that purpose, thinking of scenes to suit the music. But\n                     it was the other way around this time. Working on the music in this way likely also contributed to\n                     the delay.\n                  </p>\n<p>The aim was not to produce a totally cohesive, air tight composition to stand alone necessarily. The\n                     focus was on making a strong score. Concerns for scoring are very different from those for\n                     standalone composition. Emphasis has to be placed on serving visuals, even at the expense of more\n                     sensible composition practices sometimes, to set tone, fit the timing and such. So that’s what\n                     we did, and that was behind my thinking in piecing together the various songs I did. Like the second\n                     segment, Clark Powell’s <a href=\"/music/track/flare\" target=\"_blank\">Flare</a>, edited by\n                     Toby to fit the time allotted, and accelerate into the Snowman faceoff. And two pieces by Malcolm\n                     Brown, who accounted for a big chunk of the overall composition time. <a href=\"/music/track/savior-of-the-dreaming-dead\" target=\"_blank\">Savior\n                     of the Dreaming Dead</a>, largely unedited besides transitions, and a custom remix I asked him\n                     to do of <a href=\"/music/track/black-rose-green-sun\" target=\"_blank\">Black\n                     Rose / Green Sun</a> to finish it, which turned out awesome, especially after a few more touches\n                     by Toby &amp; co.\n                  </p>\n<p>Another couple facts to point out.</p>\n<p>- The breaks occasionally in the music are not necessarily unprompted aesthetic decisions. They\n                     resulted from the fact that I had to chop the thing up into five parts, and switching between them\n                     would invariably lead to sound skipping. So to account for this, we made the breaks as creatively\n                     deliberate as possible. Like that gap of silence just before we start following Rose and Dave. Or\n                     the silence when zooming out of LOFAF, into Skaia, then firing it back up on the Battlefield. And,\n                     obviously, the dramatic pause before the bomb goes off. I’m calling this an art through\n                     adversity situation.\n                  </p>\n<p>- I never give anyone, artist or musician, any more information than they need to know. Like I’m\n                     not saying to Toby, “ok here’s where Slick faces Snowman and shoots her through the\n                     heart, we’re gonna need something badass for that.” I give more open instruction. I say,\n                     “I think the music should start speeding up here, and get a little heavier… maybe begin\n                     quoting that piano from Flare at a lower register?” and notes of that sort. Then he makes\n                     sense of it. As silly as it sounds, I don’t like spoiling stuff even for people working on it.\n                     I’d rather leave as much a surprise for them too. Also, I’m always skeptical that giving\n                     the contributors the full picture would actually improve the product. The process is more\n                     interesting this way.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/about-eoa5-part-1\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">\n                        Posted October 26th 2011, 12:07am\n                     </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"\n                  display:none;\n                  \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

As dense as most other animations, while subjecting you to many\n                     more raw minutes of this rapid fire data. The events are portrayed nonlinearly. They shift focus\n                     between different sessions, planets, and universes, zooming into and out of them, showing them\n                     shrink, teleport, or explode spectacularly. We jump to points in a character’s chronology in\n                     the future, in the past, and examine frames of reference where chronology has no meaning. This\n                     animation is cerebrally challenging to follow. But your understanding of it will be in direct\n                     proportion to how well you understood the whole story up to this point. If you followed everything,\n                     and remember the key facts, there’s a very good chance you understood everything in the\n                     animation easily.\n                  </p>\n<p>So, let’s take a closer look at what there is to understand.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Might as well start with the biggest development.</p>\n<p><strong>The tumor was a bomb that physically contained both our universe (red side) and the troll\n                     universe (blue side). It was counting down to the “simultaneous” destruction of both\n                     universes. On detonation, it did not destroy the green sun as intended. It created it.</strong>\n</p>\n<p>I believe some people thought they were witnessing the destruction of the sun when the bomb went off.\n                     Though if you examine the scene objectively, there’s no reason to think this, other than that\n                     it was the stated mission for so long. There was no sun in sight. They were drifting through empty\n                     space. Then, boom. The sun was growing from ground zero. The fact that this misapprehension was\n                     somewhat common probably speaks to how cemented the mission to destroy the sun had become as a\n                     critical plot point. And maybe also, to how well Scratch deceived everyone on the subject.\n                  </p>\n<p>All of act 5, and to some extent all of Homestuck, has been the result of a very, very long con by\n                     Doc Scratch. His power source, and the source that fueled all this calamity in many other ways, was\n                     always going to be created in this way, by combined efforts of the kids and the trolls to save\n                     reality. Part of his job was to make sure that happened. That was the secret part of his job. The\n                     other part, openly stated, was to pave the way for the entrance of his master, which is triggered on\n                     the destruction of the troll universe, as illustrated by <a href=\"/mspa/003991\" target=\"_blank\">this virus</a>.\n                     It turns out that doing these two things is one and the same. No green sun without the death of a\n                     universe. No Lord English either.\n                  </p>\n<p>You may retrace his conversations in light of this new fact. He says he never lies, and while he’s\n                     certainly deceptive, I think you are hard pressed to find him saying something that is absolutely\n                     untrue. He misdirects, and lies by omission (which is something he makes clear he doesn’t\n                     believe in). But just about everything he says can be validated in some way. There are clues to this\n                     outcome everywhere, hiding in plain sight.\n                  </p>\n<p>Consider his conversation <a href=\"/mspa/005531\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. He\n                     speaks primarily in hypotheticals, about what would happen if they destroyed the sun. He says things\n                     often arranged like this: “And it is certainly true that The Tumor you will deliver to its\n                     location has enough power to destroy it completely.” He says they will deliver the bomb to the\n                     sun’s location. He just doesn’t mention the sun won’t be there yet. He also says\n                     its powerful enough to destroy it, hypothetically. Also true. He just doesn’t mention it won’t\n                     be around to destroy, until the bomb goes off!\n                  </p>\n<p>There’s also <a href=\"/mspa/004941\" target=\"_blank\">this\n                     tidbit</a>. “<span>TT: It is nearly twice the mass of our universe.</span>” Because it\n                     is literally comprised of the detonated mass of two dead universes. And so on.\n                  </p>\n<p>Next up. Even though this isn’t a “revelation”, it should probably be bolded and\n                     discussed.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Time and space do not work comprehensibly in the furthest ring.</strong></p>\n<p>How can the sun just have been created, when it was there all along, fueling Bec and Doc Scratch for\n                     ages, and more recently, Bec Noir, Jadesprite, etc? See above.\n                  </p>\n<p><span>TT: The greater the distance you travel through it, the less reliably time flows.</span>\n<br/><span>TT: And the more time you spend in it, the less reliably space behaves.</span>\n<br/><span>TT: Time and space aren’t as different as you might think.</span>\n</p>\n<p>So in other words, what really happened is Rose and Dave’s journey took them quite a distance\n                     through the furthest ring. The longer they traveled, the less reliably you could place them on the\n                     timeline. They may have traveled a few miles, while simultaneously wandering millions of years into\n                     the future. And after another few miles, may have gone eons into the past, way before the green sun\n                     existed. This is in fact what happened. The dark gods helped chart their course through this\n                     spacetime maze to deliver them to this location, at this time. Take that for what you will.\n                  </p>\n<p>This is also at the heart of why the sun became visible to the trolls the moment it did, rather than\n                     always being visible. It is not because it “just happened”, since the respective\n                     timeframes are incompatible, and that notion doesn’t actually make sense. The moment of\n                     Bilious Slick’s detonation (our universe), that was the moment the light from the green sun’s\n                     ancient explosion finally managed to reach their session, after its long circuitous travel through\n                     knotted spacetime. In fact, we don’t even need a complex spacetime model to understand this.\n                     Right now, there is celestial phenomena happening in our universe that we cannot see, because the\n                     light hasn’t reached us yet! It won’t for millions of years.\n                  </p>\n<p>The light from the sun is important to the trolls not only as a beacon, but as a momentary\n                     illumination of a “straight line” through the furthest ring. If light can make it from\n                     here to there through the broken space, then so can a meteor, as long as it travels fast and doesn’t\n                     miss the opportunity. This is a decent reason for the urgent getaway, as well as, presumably, the\n                     need to escape Jack’s ire while he is distracted. So Sollux went all out, putting a little\n                     extra mustard on it so to speak, and reprised his ill fated ancestor’s role as <a href=\"/mspa/005960\" target=\"_blank\">helmsman</a>.\n                  </p>\n<p>Aradia’s chronology is also worth noting. She is not actually witnessing the birth of the sun,\n                     as this (remember, nonlinear) animation seems to illustrate. When she <a href=\"/mspa/005466\" target=\"_blank\">flew inside\n                     Jack</a> to escape, the sun was already there waiting for her. Every time we have seen Aradia\n                     hanging out in front of the sun, or <a href=\"/mspa/005898\" target=\"_blank\">hanging\n                     out with Sollux’s (half-)ghost</a>, that was well after the sun was created.\n                  </p>\n<p><span>AA: i am waiting for friends to arrive</span> <br/><span>AA: they will need my help</span>\n<br/><span>TA: what friends?</span> <br/><span>TA: m0re ghosts?</span> <br/><span>AA: no theyre alive</span>\n<br/><span>AA: first</span> <br/><span>AA: there will be two humans</span> <br/><span>AA: they should be joining us any minute</span>\n</p>\n<p>She’s of course referring to Rose and Dave. And of course, at the time, we’re meant to\n                     believe they will arrive in the moon they are piloting, ready to crash kamikaze style into the sun\n                     and blow it up. There’s little reason to question this. But it turns out all along, she was\n                     waiting for them to COME OUT of the sun! As freshly minted god tiers. The nonlinear flow of the\n                     story was at every turn directing you away from the suspicion that their mission would create the\n                     sun, rather than destroy it.\n                  </p>\n<p><span>TA: then what?</span> <br/><span>AA: then rest of our party</span>\n<br/><span>AA: the survivors</span> <br/><span>TA: 0h</span> <br/><span>TA: so then, we made it 0ut here alright.</span>\n<br/><span>AA: yes</span> <br/><span>AA: well</span> <br/><span>AA: they made it</span> <br/><span>AA: your body will arrive with them</span>\n</p>\n<p>Then the trolls, who are now in transit, will theoretically rendezvous with all of them at the sun.\n                     And then what?? We’ll see.\n                  </p>\n<p>I think that’s enough to digest for now. I’ll make another part later, talking about some\n                     other aspects of the Flash, like Jack’s convoluted inter-session journey, the scratch, the\n                     expanding 4th wall and all that stuff.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/about-eoa5-part-2\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">\n                        Posted October 26th 2011, 2:17am\n                     </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"\n                  display:none;\n                  \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

This has also been referred to at points\n                     as “The Great Undoing.” From early in Hivebent: “<span>AA: and we twelve will behave simultane0usly as the pawns and the 0rchestrat0rs of the great und0ing</span>”)\n                     We know who reaches god tier and how. (All the kids!) Which trolls survive, the fate of the exiles,\n                     who wears the white queen’s ring, and how the blood got on Jack’s hand. That last\n                     question was probably the most maddening of the bunch for a long time. The bloody hand was first\n                     shown in Jade: Enter, and as Jack’s list of victims grew, his hand continued to be clean. The\n                     list of possibilities kept narrowing, until we finally found out here, along with an answer to\n                     another major question, how he actually got into the troll session.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>The circuitous journey of Bec Noir</strong></p>\n<p>A summary: after he put Jade on her quest bed, he looked up and realized he didn’t have much\n                     time. The scratch was about to wipe out the session. So, he fled the session through one of the only\n                     ways available, by riding a meteor through a portal back to Earth. The meteor was the one host to\n                     the frog ruins, and he tucked himself in the same time capsule the White King did not too long ago.\n                     The meteor crashed on prehistoric Earth, formed the ruins, and waited about 413 million years. Then\n                     the king came out of the capsule to greet the queen. Jack followed about ten seconds later to their\n                     surprise, and killed them immediately. He exited the ruins, and AR began detonating the four\n                     stations. These were rigged presumably as part of the exiles’ unspoken plan, as a failsafe to\n                     prevent Jack from doing just this, in case he found his way there. AR hesitated to blow up WV’s\n                     station, because he knew WV was still trapped inside. At this pause, Jack killed AR, and quickly\n                     entered the final remaining station to investigate, while (foolishly, it turns out) dismissing PM as\n                     irrelevant.\n                  </p>\n<p>In the station, he found <a href=\"/mspa/003311\" target=\"_blank\">this device</a>,\n                     which had been switched to the left side of the frog with the <a href=\"/mspa/005166\" target=\"_blank\">queen’s\n                     key</a>, most likely by the queen at an earlier point. Thus it would transport the user to the\n                     session outside this universe, i.e. the troll session, as opposed to the one inside it, the kid\n                     session. But it was out of power, and had been ever since <a href=\"/mspa/002657\" target=\"_blank\">WV flew the\n                     station halfway around the world to find the ruins</a>. So Jack, looking for a power source,\n                     located the uranium in WV’s belly, probably via his keen sense of smell as an omnipotent dog.\n                     He ripped the uranium out of a hapless WV’s gut, thus bloodying his hand. He powered the\n                     station, which both opened its hatch, and allowed him to flee from yet another doomed reality. He\n                     likely knew he couldn’t stay in that universe for long, since he recognized the red miles\n                     destroying it above. But he probably didn’t understand that would be his own doing from\n                     outside the universe, hours in his future.\n                  </p>\n<p>Jack, bloody hand and all, then appeared in the troll session just as the trolls were about to enter\n                     the universe they created, as we saw in <a href=\"/mspa/004827\" target=\"_blank\">Jade:\n                     Enter</a>. He then went on his murderous rampage through their session, some of which we saw in\n                     quick replays during this animation. He destroyed all 12 planets, Prospit, Derse, and finally,\n                     turned his red miles attack on Bilious Slick, destroying the very universe he just narrowly escaped\n                     from. And in doing so, he contributed his share to the critical moment. His alternate session self,\n                     Spades Slick, contributed the other part by killing Snowman, “simultaneously.” All of\n                     Act 5 could be subtitled “Jack Noir Kills Everybody” and that’s pretty much the\n                     guiding principle I had in structuring it from the start. Jack Noir has killed every major\n                     character, in one way or another (with maybe a few exceptions, like PM), including the entire\n                     population of two universes.\n                  </p>\n<p>Then, finally, as he viewed the aftermath of Bilious Slick’s destruction in Skaia’s\n                     water-sphere, and noticed the green sun appearing in the distance, he saw PM enter with WV’s\n                     body on the frog platform, the same way Jack arrived about 10 hours prior. After he left the desert,\n                     she went into the now-open station, and dragged WV’s body to safety, away from the bombs, but\n                     was faced with the universe’s imminent destruction overhead. She noticed WV had dropped the\n                     ring he’d been hiding all along, so she put it on and assumed all of Jack’s powers.\n                     Then, again probably due to enhanced canine tracking abilities, immediately knew where to follow\n                     Jack. She brought WV, likely with the hope that he may survive, as well as his firefly Serenity, and\n                     is now prepared for a duel.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Slick kills Snowman</strong></p>\n<p>It was established in the intermission that <a href=\"/mspa/003168\" target=\"_blank\">when Snowman dies,\n                     the universe is destroyed</a>. (Relating of course to her 8-ball theme, and billiards rules\n                     involving pocketing that ball, or scratching while pocketing it.) Hence, when Slick shoots her\n                     through the heart with Scratch’s single-cueball-bullet-firing gun, the trolls’ universe\n                     (blue) comes to an end. Recall that <a href=\"/mspa/005769\" target=\"_blank\">Scratch\n                     browbeat Slick into agreeing to take his gun and kill her</a>. With nothing in particular left\n                     to lose, or live for, Slick complied, and more than likely took enjoyment from settling this old\n                     score, even though it meant his own death too. Note that during the standoff, it seemed Snowman\n                     welcomed the attack. This was, after all, the culmination of her role, both as the black queen, and\n                     as a servant of Lord English.\n                  </p>\n<p>As the black queen of Derse, her basic role is to oppose creation. She wars with Prospit, and stands\n                     in the way of the heroes who seek to create a universe. Since she was exiled from the session, she\n                     could no longer fulfill that role. So she was offered another way, by Doc Scratch, in an agreement\n                     of mutual interest. Since she couldn’t oppose the creation of a new universe, she could\n                     facilitate the destruction of another. Scratch gave the queen the powers of Snowman, and bound her\n                     life in some mysterious way to the troll universe itself (turning the typically red blood of a queen\n                     to blue, the color signifying that universe). Which is of course, another giant frog much like the\n                     one Jack killed, which we have never seen from the outside. Ironically, to fulfill her role, she was\n                     bound to the life of a creature she loathed, <a href=\"/mspa/004207\" target=\"_blank\">which happened\n                     once before</a> in the troll session when they prototyped a frog. She was disgusted by the\n                     transformation, and removed the ring, which lead to her eventual exile, and <a href=\"/mspa/004211\" target=\"_blank\">meeting with\n                     Scratch in the desert</a>.\n                  </p>\n<p>Her role as Snowman also suited Lord English’s purposes, as her death provided the mechanism\n                     for his entrance, as well as contributed to the creation of the green sun. This appears to be a\n                     pattern with LE, enslaving various women, who can only die by completing their term of service, and\n                     vice versa. He recruited <a href=\"/mspa/005971\" target=\"_blank\">Aradia’s\n                     and Feferi’s ancestors</a> in the same way. From the perspective of LE as a crime boss\n                     rather than an immortal demon, he’s somewhat like a ruthless pimp. Whoever he is. This is one\n                     of the few major questions lingering, in case you didn’t notice.\n                  </p>\n<p>Anyway, more to talk about, but enough words for now.</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/about-eoa5-part-3\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">\n                        Posted October 26th 2011, 4:38pm\n                     </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"\n                  display:none;\n                  \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

Everything the royalty does is strategic in the bigger picture. The\n                     black queen was exiled, but found another way to fulfill her role through a complex maneuver of self\n                     sacrifice. The white queen’s retreat from the session, after Jack stole the black queen’s\n                     ring and wrecked Prospit and the Battlefield, was a defensive regrouping strategy on post-apocalypse\n                     Earth. She formed an elaborate plan, most of which went unwritten but could be understood mostly by\n                     deduction. Basically, she mobilized remaining exiles there, planned to leave this universe via one\n                     of the stations, destroying them all behind them to burn the bridge, but not before reuniting with\n                     the king from the time capsule. She also bestowed her title as queen to PM as her successor to rule\n                     the new kingdom they would build, and privately bestowed the responsibility on WV to some day wear\n                     the ring and hunt down Jack, wherever he might be. The problem is, Jack short-circuited her strategy\n                     by appearing immediately after the king arrived, killed WK and WQ right away, thus finally winning\n                     the chess game for his kingdom, or more particularly, himself.\n                  </p>\n<p>Almost.</p>\n<p>The final gambit belonged to PM though, when she found the ring, put it on, and inherited the true\n                     powers of a queen, more than just in name. Neither PM, nor any carapace creature, can literally be\n                     considered a pawn. But she is pawn-like in rank, as many are in this exotic and diverse race of\n                     chess people, and being the only piece left standing, she put the ring on and became the most\n                     powerful type of piece possible. Much like a pawn reaching the end of a chess board, and becoming a\n                     queen. For now, with her and Jack’s powers being about equal, the chess game sits in\n                     stalemate.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>God Tiers</strong></p>\n<p>First let’s look at what happened to Rose and Dave.</p>\n<p>When Rose asks Scratch whether she will reach god tier, <a href=\"/mspa/005530\" target=\"_blank\">he responds</a>,\n                  </p>\n<p>You have exactly a fifty percent chance of ascending to the god tier.<br/>TT: That’s a strange\n                     answer.<br/>I know.<br/>TT: Why such a precise probability?<br/>Because, much like the decisions you\n                     must face to complete your dual suicide missions, you have two ways of achieving godhood to choose\n                     from.<br/><br/>Which was before Jack killed her, and John revived her with a kiss, leaving only her\n                     dream self. When she died, this eliminated one of the ways she could reach god tier, the only way we\n                     knew of explicitly at the time. This is by having a waking self and a dream self, both alive. When\n                     the waking self dies on the quest bed located somewhere on the planet, the player’s dream self\n                     takes over permanently, assumes god tier status, and wakes up on the battlefield, while the waking\n                     self’s corpse lies dead on the quest bed thereafter. This is how John reached god tier, and\n                     how Jade did as well. (Sort of.)\n                  </p>\n<p>Dave and Rose only had one life left. They’d both been killed by Jack, and then revived as\n                     their dream selves. They only had the other means of reaching god tier, which we knew little about.\n                     We only had Aradia’s example to speculate from.\n                  </p>\n<p>It turns out, the other way involves another set of quest beds in the core of the moons of Prospit\n                     and Derse. Reaching god tier involves using the only life you have left, and dying on that quest\n                     bed. Then, rather than waking up as a god tier on the Battlefield, the dead body simply resurrects\n                     automatically, transforming then and there. This is the basic outline of the process, with some\n                     caveats from examples we’ve observed.\n                  </p>\n<p>Aradia was always a special case, since she was dead long before entering the session. She began the\n                     session as a ghost, and then a ghost inside a robot, which never actually counted as having a living\n                     waking self. She was never alive from the start, so she always only had the one ascension method\n                     available to her, by the death of her dream self, which had been sleeping on its quest bed all long.\n                     It was not in the core of the moon though. The moon only had five towers, because she was never a\n                     living player, and didn’t “belong” with the rest of the players on her team of\n                     Derse dreamers. So her dream self was sequestered away from the others, in the core of Derse. She\n                     reached god tier when Jack destroyed Derse.\n                  </p>\n<p>We also can’t be sure that’s all there is to this method. Is it a simple matter of dying\n                     on the bed, or is more required? In the only two examples we have of this, Aradia and Dave+Rose,\n                     they die spectacularly in an explosion of green fire. Is that among the requirements? This is\n                     inconclusive.\n                  </p>\n<p>Also, god tier Aradia, Dave, and Rose were all unharmed by the fire during the resurrection process.\n                     Dave and Rose’s case was so extreme, they actually <em>emerged from the core of a sun</em>.\n                     Does the transformation method itself protect them, until complete? Or is it just the simple matter\n                     that upon transforming, they are now immortal, and dying in the very explosion leading to their\n                     ascension would count as neither just nor heroic? You may speculate.\n                  </p>\n<p>After examining all that, Jade’s ascension is simple in comparison. Her dream self died, but\n                     she brought it back to life by prototyping the stuffed corpse in her grandpa’s lab, making\n                     Jadesprite. So, she did in fact have a living dream self, so option #1 was available. This had the\n                     side effect of turbo charging her god tier state. She not only has the Witch of Space powers and\n                     immortality, she merged with the sprite, which was imbued with Bec’s powers. She now has the\n                     abilities of a god tier player, a sprite, and a first guardian all in one.\n                  </p>\n<p>Ironically, the green sun which they were seeking to destroy, now powers two of the heroes opposing\n                     Jack: Jade and PM.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>The Scratch</strong></p>\n<p>This is all pretty straightforward. We saw John at the beginning, fighting very strong monsters on\n                     the Beat Mesa, and initiating the Scratch with a giant Quill of Echidna, just as he was <a href=\"/mspa/005766\" target=\"_blank\">instructed\n                     to by Karkat</a>. He killed the monsters easily with lava tornadoes and his Pop-a-matic\n                     Vrillyhoo Hammer, completed the full jagged mark across the record’s surface, and the whole\n                     Beat Mesa took off towards Skaia. It was releasing its energy the whole time, causing the Medium to\n                     crackle with that background energy you saw so often. Before it could get to Skaia, Jade teleported\n                     him to her ship. Once it entered Skaia, it fully released its temporal energy, and caused the hard\n                     reset, totally wiping out the session. But not before Jade collected all the planets, the\n                     Battlefield, and John on her Propitian battleship, and flew through a gigantic 4th wall.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>The 4th Wall</strong></p>\n<p>First of all, she didn’t actually conjure the 4th wall out of thin air. Remember when Karkat\n                     told her to <a href=\"/mspa/005152\" target=\"_blank\">turn\n                     the wall off</a>, and then <a href=\"/mspa/005153\" target=\"_blank\">draw it</a>?\n                     He was asking her to captchalogue an undamaged copy using her Pictionary modus, for this exact\n                     purpose. The eventual getaway. So she had it on standby, waiting for the right time to use it.\n                  </p>\n<p>As she expanded it, and we crept ever closer to the completion of the scratch, we saw individual\n                     panels from early in the story flashing backwards. From a visualization standpoint, this is just\n                     reminding us that the scratch is in fact undoing everything we just read, all the way back to page\n                     one, and starting over fresh in a different instantiation of the universe. But if you want to\n                     understand why all that was literally being broadcast through the wall at that moment, you could\n                     consider what happened to be on the other side of the wall: <a _blank\"\"=\"\" href=\"/mspa/005130 target=\">Lord English’s\n                     coat</a>. Why would the interior of the coat broadcast those flashbacks? No need to get into it\n                     too much. Suffice to say, it belongs to someone purported to be a master of time.\n                  </p>\n<p>Will the coat still be there the moment they crash through the glass? Recall that this is all\n                     happening “simultaneously” with the rest of the critical moment, which is the juncture\n                     that summons him. When he is summoned, he may need his coat. Whether he retrieves it or not, we’ll\n                     just have to see.\n                  </p>\n<p>What’s waiting for them on the other side, beside a big ugly coat? Recall the setup I had with\n                     the <a href=\"/mspa/005933\" target=\"_blank\">two\n                     4th walls facing each other, separated by one yard</a>. They will break through the wall on the\n                     right, traveling nearly the speed of light, and presumably, break through the wall on the left to\n                     enter another reality. If you were thorough during <a href=\"/mspa/005595\" target=\"_blank\">Seer:\n                     Descend</a>, you might have caught this excerpt on a bookshelf. “Though we adore Him we\n                     shall never enjoy His beauteous Croak. We spill our blood on acres of black and white so they may\n                     cross the yellow yard. At last in Skaia’s reflection through broken glass He may find the pond\n                     in which He’s meant to squat.”\n                  </p>\n<p>The yellow yard, regarding <a href=\"/mspa/005558\" target=\"_blank\">my self indulgent\n                     spiel</a> about the degree of author intervention to expect, very simply refers to the physical\n                     distance between the two 4th walls the heroes will pass through, to escape from a doomed reality\n                     into one of promise. The heroes will coexist with me, the author, for the span of three feet, and\n                     while traveling very quickly, for the duration of thee nanoseconds. This was always my tongue in\n                     cheek way of quantifiably demonstrating the absolute minimum degree of influence an author insert\n                     can have on the story, while not having none. It’s essentially a gag, but serving a practical\n                     purpose in the story, and a very concrete, understandable mechanism by which they may hop between\n                     realities.\n                  </p>\n<p>I am also pretending that my personal interaction with Doc Scratch doesn’t count as influencing\n                     the story directly. It’s influencing the way the story is told, which after all, is what\n                     authors tend to do.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/about-eoa5-part-4\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">\n                        Posted October 26th 2011, 10:00pm\n                     </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"\n                  display:none;\n                  \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

Where is Scratch’s wrecked apartment\n                     floating?</strong> It’s free-floating debris from the two universes destroyed, which now\n                     comprise the green sun. That floating hunk of building is suspended, and temporarily preserved in,\n                     let’s call it a small pocket of green-hot spacetime soup inside the sun. Chronologically, this\n                     little pocket of space is very near the final dying moment of the troll universe, where LE makes his\n                     entrance. He then goes back in time to fuck shit up throughout the history of that universe, as has\n                     been described many times. That is why he was always “already there.” It is also\n                     because, as it turns out, he was lurking dormant in Scratch’s puppet-host body the whole time.\n                     Doc always did claim to be excellent host.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Is Scratch literally Lord English? Or has LE completely replaced him? How much of Scratch’s\n                     cognizance/personality/being is still in LE?</strong> Well, here’s what the story told us.\n                     Scratch said he had to die for LE to be brought into this universe. Now we have seen why explicitly.\n                     Scratch doesn’t lie, when it comes to simple statements of fact. He only excludes details and\n                     clarification. So, he is now dead. LE has officially replaced him, albeit traveled back in time to\n                     coexist with him, presumably continuing to utilize him as an employee, in all the ways we know\n                     about, and maybe others we don’t. They’re separate entities. Though because they share\n                     the same body more or less, and essentially the same origin, they share properties. Both have the\n                     powers of a first guardian (though Scratch said outright LE was more powerful than him). Both have\n                     “Cal genes,” whatever the hell that means. In LE’s case, the resemblance is\n                     obvious. They share an interest in the ladies (Scratch takes a shining to younger ones while LE\n                     ropes more mature females into service. Reasoning? Scratch is a young LE!) They appear to have\n                     opposite demeanors though. Scratch is calm, calculating, manipulative. English is brutal, angry, and\n                     out to wreak havoc on a universe without any particular desire for subtlety. Their appearances\n                     reflect the differences. Is LE omniscient like Scratch? There’s evidence that he’s a\n                     strong tactician and adept with time travel, but its unclear whether he maintains the omniscience\n                     post-transformation. Consider that Scratch’s omniscience was closely tied to the other half of\n                     his genetic makeup, a magic cueball which had all the answers to everything concealed within. When\n                     LE transformed, he kept all the Cal properties (magnified them actually), but dropped the cueball\n                     aspect. In fact, his cueball head exploded outright. This was “the break” Scratch\n                     referred to once or twice. A literal description of LE’s emergence, as well as reference to\n                     the pool term, where the cueball scatters all the other balls, and the game begins.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"/mspa/005500\" target=\"_blank\">T1CK</a> <a href=\"/mspa/005502\" target=\"_blank\">T0CK</a> <a href=\"/mspa/005503\" target=\"_blank\">BR8K</a> <a href=\"/mspa/005504\" target=\"_blank\">H34DS</a> <a href=\"/mspa/005507\" target=\"_blank\">honk\n                     HONK</a></strong>. This is not a question, but some notes anyway. This string of genetic code\n                     letters is probably the most clear and present foreshadowing of LE’s transformation. It is\n                     practically a brief sentence describing the process, in order, culminating in LE’s vast honk.\n                     I think this one clue got some people speculating, correctly, that LE would emerge in some way from\n                     Scratch, involving his head breaking open. Probably a minority theory, but it was out there, because\n                     the clues were there. Revelations in a story are shocking in proportion to how little groundwork was\n                     laid for that development, and how obscured the clues were, if they even existed at all. It would\n                     have been more startling if LE turned out to be some ridiculous preexisting character, like\n                     Maplehoof or Charles Dutton or whatever, but the shock value would come with no credible basis in\n                     the narrative. So big reveals like this always come with sort of a balancing act of establishing\n                     clues to make the event credible and premeditated, while obscuring/misdirecting so as not to totally\n                     blow it. No matter how well you disguise it, if the clues are there, some will guess it. Personally,\n                     I feel like the shock value is not so much stored in the fact that Scratch = LE, but in the sudden,\n                     disturbing nature and presentation of the transformation itself. And hey, if the Scratch = LE tidbit\n                     happened to catch you way off guard, I’ll consider it a bonus.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Why’s LE honking like Gamzee???</strong> If you’re prepared to be very literal,\n                     you might believe LE’s honking is a symptom of Gamzee’s influence in some way, due to\n                     time shenanigans or what have you. Examined logically, it’s the other way around. On LE’s\n                     arrival, he releases the vast honk Gamzee’s religion foretold. LE has always been around\n                     influencing troll culture from the start, and it seems he was always the embodiment of the mirthful\n                     messiahs the highbloods worshiped, since he was really two beings, Doc Scratch and LE, both “mirthful”\n                     puppet-based entities, in their own ways. Gamzee’s honking, the humorous brutality of the\n                     subjugglators and their dark spiritual beliefs, all could be traced to LE. The vast honk clip was\n                     actually a heavily modified sound clip of a bike horn, like one of Gamzee’s, slowed way down.\n                     First a small honk from the squeeze, then a big one from the unsqueeze. Sounds a lot like the noise\n                     the tripods made in War of the Worlds, which has me convinced those were made from slowed down bike\n                     horns too.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>What’s with the sarcophagus?</strong> That is actually the alternate form of the <a href=\"/mspa/003153\" target=\"_blank\">Cairo Overcoat</a>,\n                     which doubles as his notorious oversized garment, and his chariot in which he travels through time,\n                     not terribly unlike Dr. Who’s TARDIS. The name and functionality was spawned completely from\n                     the <a href=\"/mspa/001057\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago\n                     Overcoat</a>, which was the name of Mobster Kingpin’s flying pirate ship/office. Chicago\n                     Overcoat is also mobster slang for a coffin, therefore a Cairo Overcoat must refer to a Sarcophagus.\n                     (Which also happens to have a Terminator skull over the Pharaoh’s face.) LE’s ties to\n                     Egyptian lore in part trace back to a reference, through his attire obviously, to Joseph and the\n                     Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, a significant part of which takes place in Egypt. Also, more vaguely,\n                     the coat struck me as something that might be worn by one or more iterations of Dr. Who. And lest we\n                     forget the most obvious quality of its appearance, something that could easily adorn a pimp. As with\n                     many things in HS, there’s quite a slurry of references coming together to form something\n                     basically ridiculous, and yet dead fucking serious. LE is many things. A time traveling crime lord\n                     pimp. An omnipotent, indestructible puppet-based demon. A monster born out of an ancient, short,\n                     smug, cueball-headed gunslinger, the blight of two universes by his birth alone. An Egyptian pharaoh\n                     Incredible Hulk in shredded pants and suspenders with a green <a href=\"/mspa/002470\" target=\"_blank\">Jigsaw\n                     puppet</a>-like skull for head, a gold fang, and flashing pool balls for eyes. And with his gold\n                     cuestick pegleg and long coat, appears to also be somewhat reminiscent of a pirate, and may or may\n                     not bear some tenuous connection to Skipper Plumbthroat, nemesis of all Squiddles, who have been\n                     clearly shown to be friendly cartoon-standins for the dark gods.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>So LE is the Hulk in suspenders with a Cal skull for a head………\n                     really????</strong> Yes, really. I think his appearance is not what most were expecting, nor what\n                     some desired, but this is a consequence of hype factor alone. It’s inevitable, keeping a\n                     mystery such as this dangling out there for almost two years. People start to get attached to what\n                     they envision. There is no creative advantage at all to hype. When hype is significant, you can only\n                     hope to meet it at best, or more likely fall short. I felt pretty fortunate that by and large the\n                     hype surrounding EOA5 was met for most people. I’m doubtful it was surpassed for many, by\n                     much, considering the two month pause caused people to guess SOMETHING big was coming. Now imagine\n                     instead of a two month delay, there was none at all! Bam, 13 minute animation out of nowhere. The\n                     difference in reader perception in such a case is so extreme, it can’t even be communicated.\n                     Conclusion: hype sux.\n                  </p>\n<p>This is exactly how I pictured LE looking before I even made the Felt intermission. I think if I\n                     revealed him then, practically everyone would say, yeah that’s about right. Just a nasty,\n                     monstrous looking mob boss with some gaudy accoutrements. In time, as the mystique surrounding him\n                     accumulates, people get other ideas. I think some wanted a more suave motherfucker to bust onto the\n                     scene, someone perhaps sleek, dapper. This doesn’t fit the concept at all, nor suits anything\n                     we knew about him previously. Doc Scratch is his smooth, well mannered counterpart. He already fills\n                     that role. LE as Scratch 2 is a really boring idea to me. LE as a big, no-nonsense brute,\n                     functioning as Mr. Hyde to Scratch’s Dr. Jekyll, is much more interesting. (Hey, there’s\n                     another bullet point for the reference slurry, if you’re taking notes, re: Jekyll/Hyde.) So\n                     instead of some elegant dude too dashing for words who exploded from the screen of the yaoiest anime\n                     you ever saw, he looks a bit like <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/final_fight_boss1.jpg\">this</a>\n                     and\n                     <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/the-incredible-hulk.jpg\">this</a>\n                     and maybe some of <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/thelizard.jpg\">this</a>\n                     and a smidgeon of <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/Captain-America-Red-Skull_510.jpg\">this</a>\n                     and\n                     <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/2004_starsky_and_hutch_005.jpg\">oh\n                     yeah some of this</a> and <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/Lilcal01.jpg\">a whole fuckload\n                     of this</a> and <a href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/lil_cal_by_kajoi-d3fowot.jpg\">just\n                     a pinch of this</a>, ok wait maybe not that last thing.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/le-factoids\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">\n                        Posted November 4th 2011, 6:13pm\n                     </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"\n                  display:none;\n                  \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

In this case I just went with some\n                     super simple vanilla names starting with J and similar to the names of their counterparts. Besides,\n                     their placronyms were already engraved years ago.

Also,\n                     it means he has the same initials as John.\n                  </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"katrka\" href=\"/tumblr/katrka\">katrka</a> asked\n                     you: </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> How excited were you to get to this act and reveal these new characters? </em></p>\n<p>It’s hard to say, because most of the excitement over the idea was generated when the idea itself was\n                     formed, which was around two years ago. The whole kid-guardian swap thing grew out of the\n                     development of their ectobiological origin story, and I thought it was a fun idea to build toward.\n                     In fact, a huge amount of the way I structured the plot was centered around this idea. A big part of\n                     the inspiration for the hard reset concept was to facilitate this idea I thought had a lot of\n                     exciting potential.\n                  </p>\n<p>But then after the excitement of the initial conceptualization, there’s the long trek to get there,\n                     accompanied by grueling labors of execution. There were pockets of time when excitement was\n                     reinvigorated, like during weeks of tedious animation, it’s hard not to think “man it sure would be\n                     way more fun to make some new kids go on cool adventures instead of this bullshit.” But for the most\n                     part, once it was time to put the idea in play, it had been around in my head so long, the reaction\n                     is more like “welp, here we are.”\n                  </p>\n<p>Additionally, because this idea was around for so long, there is a huge amount of foreshadowing\n                     groundwork laid for it, much of which is barely veiled. By the time we got into the little backstory\n                     arc about the scratched ancestor session and their swapped roles, it was pretty loud and clear. That\n                     was like me sitting in a lifeguard tower yelling in a bullhorn “GET READY FOR THE KID GUARDIAN\n                     SESSION, THIS IS WHAT’S HAPPENING.” There are lots of major curveballs thrown at you in HS.

It’s been\n                     around for centuries, but was not incorporated into the zodiac most people are familiar with, for\n                     whatever reason. Hence, the “13th troll” has been a point of furious speculation since the first\n                     appearance of the trolls in the story. So…\n                  </p>\n<p>That is what the deal with that is.</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"sprinkletit\" href=\"/tumblr/sprinkletit\">sprinkletit</a>\n                     asked you: </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> what’s the sweet bro and hella jeff moive plot? </em></p>\n<p>I don’t know, but I think plot is probably the wrong word.</p>\n<p>Opening the film with a ten minute montage of bro falling down some stairs would probably be the\n                     conservative approach. Just some really solid stage setting, established in classical film making\n                     tradition to butter up the critics. It also clearly sets up a strong antagonist for the moive,\n                     stairs. It is a foe which is never bested, for you see, the film is an American tragedy.\n                  </p>\n<p>Other than that, probably lots of profane non sequitur and hug bumps issued by Wilson and Stiller,\n                     who will have been heavily coached in their acting to achieve a sort of rigid, surrealistic demeanor\n                     just off the mark of any heretofore observed human behavior. Like the uncanny valley of mannerism.\n                     Lace heavily with artifacts, visual and audible, and don’t be surprised if at some point a 20 minute\n                     clip of a completely different movie is inserted, uncut, flipped vertically, and tortured with\n                     various Photoshop filters. Finally, the climax will be the stunning resolution to a series of\n                     dilemmas not previously introduced in the film, all of which center around the inability of either\n                     character to perform simple motor functions.

If asked to define\n                     it, “a story that’s also a puzzle” is as close to true as any answer I’d give.\n                  </p>\n<p>Should all entertainment be like that? No way. But <em>something</em> should be like that, because\n                     something like that should exist. That’s why puzzles exist, because puzzles are cool sometimes, and\n                     are challenging. We don’t go up to a jigsaw puzzle and go, “why the fuck is this in so many\n                     different PIECES, what kind of IDIOT would break this nice picture into TINY LITTLE BITS?!!” Nor do\n                     we want all of our nice pictures broken into bits like that. Some we just want to hang on walls and\n                     look at.\n                  </p>\n<p>But unlike a jigsaw puzzle, there’s much to enjoy without having to solve it. Fun characters and\n                     silly moments. But if you turn your brain on, you can engage with the complexity and depth. If you\n                     turn it ALL the way on, you can get everything, and solve the puzzle. There is a range of ways to\n                     interface with it, from the casual to the maniacal. Failing to grasp everything shouldn’t preclude\n                     basic enjoyment, nor is it a symptom of failure by either the reader or the story.\n                  </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>Here is the very last question that squeaked in before I shut down the box.</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"wweenie\" href=\"/tumblr/wweenie\">wweenie</a> asked\n                     you: </em>\n</p>\n<p><em> Thank you for making such an amazing webcomic! </em></p>\n<p>You’re welcome, and thanks for reading it!</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/answers\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted November 12th 2011, 2:46am</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

The current size is\n                     actually the size it should be, and has been for most of the site’s existence.\n                  </p>\n<p>I have no idea when or why or how, but at some point the text got smaller. It may have been during\n                     the last site redesign, and I didn’t notice. Or actually, I did, but in that timeframe I was\n                     so up to my neck in computer problems, OS reinstalls and browser version upgrades, I think I\n                     attributed it to something to do with my system rather than something in the code. I didn’t\n                     really have time or care enough to investigate until now.\n                  </p>\n<p>Aliased, 14 point, bolded Courier New has always been “the look”, and that’s\n                     reinforced a lot of times when you see text embedded in GIF images.

I’m\n                     just letting you know how it is, and how it was always supposed to be. I’m not that rigid\n                     about this issue, since I always knew this format’s presentation is invariably going to be\n                     device-dependent for the reader.\n                  </p>\n<p>The official text look includes the hard pixel edges. I never wanted the text to be anti-aliased at\n                     all. I think smooth-edged courier looks hella gross. If you have Windows, go to display settings and\n                     turn off ClearType, if you care to. If you use a Mac, you might be stuck with smooth text no matter\n                     what. I’m not sure. But then, if you use a Mac, you’re probably in love with\n                     super-smooth text regardless, so that’s cool.\n                  </p>\n<p>I actually like aliased text on the web a lot better in general. Maybe I’m just old school. It’s\n                     sharper and easier to read. ClearType with a lot of fonts, especially small ones, is just bleary\n                     mush. I’m not really down with the idea of screens trying to be paper. It’s a false\n                     ideal, and it’s never been pulled off effectively, outside of e-ink on Kindles and stuff.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/font-size\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\"> Posted November 13th, 2011</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

I\n                     of course refused, but graciously accepted the money anyway, and proceeded to labor over the spiritually\n                     meretricious document myself. I additionally made a somber vow to spend all one hundred and fifty\n                     dollars on a humorously mediocre Italian meal served at the Olive Garden, a chain to which American\n                     families compliantly fork over their dinner plans each year by the tens of billions, probably. I also\n                     pledged that I would record the endeavor carefully, in a drawn out faux-journalistic spiel that had\n                     loads of jokes in it. But since I’m currently weighed down with an olympiadic bronze statue’s\n                     fist worth of shitty pasta in my belly, and feeling a bit off, I give you this essay instead.<br/><br/>\n<!-- more --><br/>I should say in my defense that after pocketing the choice soulbux, I did manage to\n                     dog the everloving balls out of this expedition for well over a year. When I first sealed the pledge, I\n                     did so with a spirit of adventure, but this quickly gave way to an understandable sense of all-consuming\n                     dread. If I even suspected I caught a whiff of the unique melange of garlic and body odor which\n                     persistently howls from any Olive Garden’s exterior ventshafts, I would begin to shake\n                     uncontrollably. But these articles have always been mostly about conveying how brave I am, so it shouldn’t\n                     surprise you to learn that I eventually triumphed over this adversity to become way more admirable than\n                     the guy who climbed Mount Everest without a spinal cord.<br/><br/>In dogging the trip so bad, to be\n                     honest, I had some help. From God. Any time I reluctantly made plans to go to the nearest OG, which\n                     always seemed to be at least fifty fucking minutes away from wherever I was, those plans would get\n                     sabotaged by an angry wrathful God who hates me, and yet still took time to derail my Olive Garden plans\n                     because even He wouldn’t wish that on His worst enemy (which I probably am). One time last winter,\n                     <a href=\"http://qwantz.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan North</a> was in town\n                     looking to be shown a good time, so I was like, hey, there’s this Olive Garden thing I’ve\n                     been dragging my shit on forever, we might as well join forces and put a bullet through the head of that\n                     long suffering obligation. Because when he said “to be shown good time,” I misheard him and\n                     thought he said “to experience major gastrointestinal surgery.” Sadly, neither thing\n                     happened, because that’s when the Weatherchrist dumped five feet of snow on New England and we\n                     couldn’t even go outside. I never saw him again.<br/><br/>Flashforward to now, when I saw him\n                     again. He was heading into town to sign books, and we were both like, do we DARE tempt fate again by\n                     resurrecting the nasty reeking spectre of my Olive Garden pledge? Obviously we did (brave) and Ryan was\n                     richly rewarded from the malevolent Beepbeepjesus by having his car break down between Toronto and here,\n                     and he was forced to spend the night in a weird little town. Our mistake was probably in making the\n                     plans out loud or something, rather than winking via text message. Or in making the plans even remotely\n                     specific, by scouting out the location of the nearest Olive Garden, which was brooding somewhere in the\n                     fecula of New England’s black asshole, Springfield Massachusetts. Fortunately, Ryan shares my\n                     adventurous spirit and disdain for sparing expense, and applied about 10,000 Canadian dollars toward\n                     getting his vehicle operational. He texted me something like, plan’s back on tight brotimes, and\n                     after an involuntary series of spasms, I replied with something like, cool, as long as the rig is sturdy\n                     enough to launch us over one of the broken highway ramps to clear the perpetually flaming wall of\n                     garbage that surrounds Springfield.<br/><br/><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/springfieldmass.jpg\"><img height=\"550\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/springfieldmass.jpg\" width=\"475\"/></a><br/><br/>He assured me his vessel was\n                     sound. He’s a modest guy and tends to understate, so you see when he pulled up to the curb in his\n                     once humble gray Ford, it was now tricked out Mad Max style for our journey into this shrieking gulf of\n                     hate. Ok that was a fucking lie. Just a little embellishment to make you laugh, ok? The first and only\n                     you’ll see in this essay. <em>Sorry</em>.<br/><br/>Other people starting catching wind of this\n                     plan’s curious brown stonk and soon the affair snowballed into a BFD. <a href=\"http://www.overcompensating.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Rowland</a>\n                     was like, this sounds retarded. And I was like, awesome, Jeffrey’s on board. John Keogh was musing\n                     to himself that he couldn’t even remember the last time he vomited, so what the hell. <a href=\"http://gunshowcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">KC Green</a> took it as a\n                     matter of personally directed malice that one was not supposed to be able to locate the bottom of the\n                     breadstick basket, so he snugged up his bib and said let’s goddamn mosey. Agent Paperklip and\n                     Softowl were ensnared by the promise of spectacle. The ladies get codenames on #OGnite. That’s how\n                     shit works.<br/><br/>We took two cars because that’s a lot of people. I went in Ryan’s car.\n                     Ryan has a GPS navigator, and in his own voice he had re-recorded all the audio files it uses for\n                     navigation, like “in ___ miles” and “take a U-turn.” This sounds like it could\n                     be the second lame embellishment of the story, but it really isn’t. When you turn it on, his voice\n                     says “Oh my god, do everything I tell you.” And when the thing is supposed to say “then”\n                     in between instructions, Ryan draws out the syllable almost sarcastically, as “theeEEEEEeeennnnn.”\n                     And when you miss a turn, he interrupts, “Hold on. Someone messed up.” Turns out we would\n                     hear that last one a few times. The thing is, if you want Ryan’s soothing, masculine voice to get\n                     you to your crappy pasta destination, you actually have to program the right fucking Olive Garden into\n                     it. We plugged the wrong one in, while Crew Jeffrey was speeding toward a different restaurant. The only\n                     thing worse than a big party trying to get to one Springfield Olive Garden is a big party accidentally\n                     trying to get to two totally different Springfield Olive Gardens, and anyway the last thing you ever\n                     want to do in Springfield is split up and divide the strength of your numbers.<br/><br/>So Jeffrey makes\n                     it to the correct OG about 20 minutes before we do, calls us and says, guys, there’s a 25 minute\n                     wait to be seated. I pause and say, there’s really that many people there on a Monday night? He\n                     says yeah man, I think they’re here ON PURPOSE. I’m like holy shit. As incredible as it\n                     seems, hundreds of Americans DELIBERATELY piled into this little stuccoed commercial building covered in\n                     idiotic Mediterranean trellises, and did so for ENJOYMENT, as a thing they ACTUALLY WANTED TO DO. This\n                     is it seems for many people a recreational evening activity pursued regularly, which they seek out by\n                     dint of something approximating free will. I had to doublecheck with Jeffrey, so like, these people AREN’T\n                     here as a culmination of a half-decade-spanning, barely comprehensible internet scam? “Yeah, man…”\n                     he trailed off, palpably spooked.<br/><br/>Team Ryan rolls in finally, and we gather for five minutes\n                     before being seated, puzzling over a gregarious public awash in their strange appetites. In the mirth of\n                     the environs and perhaps as a form of euphoric release after a long and arduous journey, I must have\n                     struck passers by as guy totally psyched about this piece of shit restaurant. A guy completely chuffed\n                     off his ass to be scoring exactly ONE divided by ZERO breadsticks tonight, shit, yes. Though to be fair,\n                     my resplendent soul was probably betraying my true feelings.<br/><br/><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGeuphoria.jpg\"><img height=\"355\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGeuphoria.jpg\" width=\"475\"/></a><br/><br/><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos1.jpg\"><img src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos1.jpg\"/></a><br/><br/>In\n                     the next installment of this gauntlet’s recitation, I will describe the meal.

But I don’t think I\n                     pictured the audience getting this big quite this fast. In 5 years? Maybe. 2 years? No. If it keeps\n                     increasing at similar rates, at the 5 year mark it’ll be something ridiculous that I was\n                     completely unprepared for in my most fantastical estimates, and I’ll probably have to\n                     reevaluate what the fuck it is I’m actually trying to accomplish here. 1 million readers per\n                     day as appears to be the case now still seems somewhat manageable, primarily if I just don’t\n                     think about it and keep working on stuff. But what if it’s like 20 million in a few years? I\n                     don’t even know what to think about that. That seems like a weirdly disproportionate reality\n                     for something that was just supposed to be a ridiculous little web cartoon one guy scratches out\n                     with his spare time. That is more like a hit tv show that by some cruel mistake got trapped on the\n                     internet leaving some poor slob to somehow manage. Hit tv shows that rope in 20 million viewers have\n                     these entire networks run by executives who fly in private jets to make big time decisions for them\n                     and figure out how to manage the monstrous demands of the public. And yet as insane as it sounds\n                     given recent trends this feels like an outcome I actually should be thinking about and preparing for\n                     in some way.\n                  </p>\n<p>This is probably as good as any reason to start ticking down the GREAT ANDREW HUSSIE CORPORATE\n                     SELLOUT CLOCK.

Sì grazie!”) The wad of hard collateral weighed down the table the whole time we\n                     were there, and I made good and sure the waitress could see it up front so she knew we meant\n                     business. The waitress was trained in a dialect I think OG Corporate calls Family-CasuAffable, which\n                     primarily involves pretending that strange internet people actually belong in public, and every\n                     inscrutable in-joke they blurt out is totally hilarious. She would be rewarded heavily for her role\n                     in this charade, oh yes. Primarily through self-administered alcohol and pain medication after\n                     hours, one can only hope.<br/><br/><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos3.gif\"><img src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos3.gif\"/></a><br/><br/>While\n                     in my wallet, the one hundred and fifty dollars had naturally sopped up much of my soul’s\n                     heady puissance, and hot rainbow lasers were rioting from the eyeballs of seven and a half\n                     psychedelic Andrew Jacksons all night long. This fierce little militia of technicolor A-Jax sitting\n                     there on the table served a real purpose, and not just to remind everybody other than me how shabby\n                     and unremarkable their souls were. It reminded us of the steep hill we had to climb that evening, to\n                     somehow burn through a buck fifty at an Olive Garden, an establishment notorious for its bargains.\n                     This is a corporation which manages to turn a PROFIT by hemorrhaging tornadoes of free bread and\n                     salad by some dark fiscal entropy yet uncharted by economists. Their shit is priced to mother\n                     fucking <em>move</em>, you know? And here we are toting madd-staxx, sashaying like the Rockefellers\n                     into the eye of this pitiless food geyser, derricked to the earth by salmon stuccoed drywall and\n                     stock gondola music. If someone put a gun to your head, do you think <em>you</em> could unload just\n                     shy of eight Andy J-Bombs at an OG on ANYTHING? And by “put a gun to your head,” I mean\n                     for the purpose of this hypothetical, and not during the ordeal one naturally expects to face when\n                     entering the OG men’s room. Yeah, we weren’t so sure we could do it either. I mean, they\n                     were already putting like five upended plastic lampshades full of breadsticks on the table before we\n                     could even crack a menu and make a battleplan for carving up this soul money. Soul money which I\n                     remind you I HAD to spend. See, there really was a guy with a gun to my head. His name was <em>THE\n                     INTERNET</em>.<br/><br/>So you’ll understand when I tell you I pored over the menu in a\n                     state of critical anguish over the rock-bottom prices, crunching figures on my iPhone calculator and\n                     swearing louder than babies were crying. I was worried the Internet was too rich for my britches,\n                     and we’d never manage to pack away 7.5 iridescent American fucking Lions worth of gutbusting\n                     Familinguini®. But just as the harsh presidential scowls of those 15 Xander Hambones and their scorn\n                     for my weakness could reduce me to ash, that’s when common sense finally set the fuck in. We\n                     could just drink the money away. Hell, we already had a head start on that plan before diagnosing it\n                     as the master stroke it was. So with a flourish of my limp wrist, I made a gesture probably deeply\n                     offensive to Italians beckoning the waitress, and demanded two of the most expensive bottles of wine\n                     in the house. Soon, two complex, full bodied little numbers were brought to us, each cradled in\n                     white linens like a newborn king, and just like that we were already another $7.90 in the hole.\n                     <br/><br/>The plan. It was working PERFECTLY.<br/><br/>The Olive Garden is good for two things only.\n                     It is good for grand marshaling a harrowing parade of internet-driven baloney, as you can plainly\n                     see. And it is good for getting hammered in. I honestly don’t know why you would go there to\n                     do anything other than get wasted. The only other reason to go would be if you’re a police\n                     officer replying to a 911 call furtively pocket-dialed from the restroom. Or if you’re a\n                     health inspector, scooting by to pick up your bribe wedged under the dumpster out back. That’s\n                     it.<br/><br/><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos4.jpg\"><img height=\"268\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/OGphotos4.jpg\" width=\"475\"/></a><br/><br/>Ryan and I would take turns ordering drinks; one guy would\n                     be designated to name the drink to the waitress, while the other would follow with a snappy\n                     ultimatum, “Make it a double.” Among the first rounds she brought us were a pair of\n                     Venetian Sunsets, which we agreed to consume after a little convincing it wasn’t slang for\n                     some kind of STD. It was one of those pink drinks that gradates to something not as pink, and you\n                     aren’t supposed to drink it if you’re a man. But that’s a trick stipulation,\n                     because a real man wouldn’t give a fuck. Any guy who balks at tossing back a Venetian Sunset\n                     or a Parisian Ticklefight or a Chattanooga Handjob is in actuality a blue ribbon pony’s\n                     meticulously primped vagina. (I’m quoting Ryan’s GPS device verbatim there, FYI.)\n                     Jeffrey got some crazy drink that had so much booze in it, the glass it came in couldn’t even\n                     hold all the booze, and the rest came in this odd, graceful little vial carefully placed next to it.\n                     I don’t know what that was supposed to be and neither did he. It looked like some tiny flute\n                     of nectar you’d give to an elf to make it stop playing tricks on you. <br/><br/>Clearly a lot\n                     of alcohol was going to be taken in that evening. So we had a choice. We could either be treated for\n                     alcohol poisoning, taking advantage of the OG’s convenient bi-hourly shuttle service to the\n                     Springfield hospital. Or we could eat some of the atrocious bargain fare being carted to the table\n                     at impossibly frequent intervals, to absorb some of the booze. This was really the genius of the\n                     plan, here. Using the OG’s own cruel contraband, the free breadsticks, to <em>stave off</em>\n                     poisoning. The breadsticks are really bad, and that’s not just me going, ha ha, here are some\n                     more jokes. They’re straightup nastyloaves. Imagine one of those little Nerf footballs.\n                     Imagine it’s stripped of paint and elongated a bit. Now soak it in bleach for a week. Then,\n                     once it is white as chalk, bake it at 800 degrees for 10 minutes. Then brush the loaf in a thin but\n                     powerful adhesive solution, and completely submerge it in a vat of salt. Put five of these loves\n                     into a basket, and put five of these baskets on to the table every five minutes until the party\n                     leaves, or is otherwise removed from the restaurant. <br/><br/>Is that enough of this story? I’m\n                     gonna say yeah. The bottom line is, the plan was a huge success, in that we’re all basically\n                     still alive somehow. <br/><br/>TLDR; the final tab was a little over $200, applied mostly toward\n                     beverages, and a smattering of semi-edible food. We went home and took a long hard look at our lives\n                     and drew no particular conclusion. North got in his car soldiered in the direction of his namesake\n                     to presumably put in another hard shift of “being in Canada.” Rowland went back to\n                     mailing way too many tee shirts to goofballs who like funny words on their chests, and maybe also\n                     run for mayor?(??) Keogh, Green and Paperklip went back to get bossed around by Rowland a little\n                     more, because that’s what he is, their boss. Softowl cleared her throat before Ryan got into\n                     his car, and he said oh, looked embarrassed, pulled the Ms. Paint figurine from his pocket, and\n                     eventually returned it.<br/><br/>Let’s never mention the Olive Garden again.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/land-of-souls-and-olives-a-conclusion-plmfers-part\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on December 1st, 2011</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

Regardless, people\n                     have already bought a bunch since the word got out anyway. I’m not linking to the store\n                     directly, for now, to stave off a little extra traffic. If you are very motivated to buy these\n                     books, you may go to the topatoco site and seek them out.\n                  </p>\n<p>It’s not even a bandwidth issue really.

The selection isn’t as extensive as you might \n                     think, so that creates a bit of a puzzle as to which icon gets slotted \n                     to which color. The tee is often a different color from the hoodie, and \n                     the basic governing logic is the tee represents color of the hood in the\n                     outfit, while the hoodie is the main color, for a little diversity. \n                     There are a few exceptions, like the space tee is also black instead of \n                     very dark gray. Exceptions like that are also usually due to color \n                     selection limitations.\n                  </p>\n<p>I designed the symbols themselves with an \n                     eye toward simplicity, verging on minimalism, and visual consistency \n                     within a developing iconic vocabulary. That’s why you see these latest \n                     two echo aspects of others. Life is a simple transform of a tilted \n                     breath symbol, while void is kind of a “hollowed out” space symbol.\n                  </p>\n<p>In\n                     my mind there are some subtle aesthetic principles guiding their \n                     construction. Ways in which curves behave, adherence to radial symmetry \n                     at times, certain ways the forms are sliced and aligned, etc. I’ve seen \n                     quite a few fan made projections of the unreleased icons. While there \n                     are a bunch of nice icons out there, not many strike me as that suitable\n                     for the god tier icon vocabulary, at least as I’ve pictured it.\n                  </p>\n<p>I\n                     think it’s another one of those situations where “headcanons” clash \n                     with the reality as unveiled. Probably some are interested in more \n                     diversity in form than what you see, where void ends up being largely a \n                     transformation of space? Think of it this way. It’s hard to get worked \n                     up at the dude who invented the alphabet because the “p” is just a \n                     backwards “q”. That’s part of the point of a vocabulary of shapes, to \n                     introduce some standardization and logical repetition of form. \n                     Simplicity is also key, from precedents already set. Time was just a \n                     gear. Nothing too inherently exciting about that. The idea is to use \n                     very simple, usually abstract shapes to convey these broad concepts, \n                     while also building a little self-consistent pictographic language.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/a-bit-slow-right-now\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on December 7th, 2011                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

The truth is, there is not\n                     much distinction between the layers of abstraction and the reality they are meant to stand for. John\n                     was both literally named on his 13th birthday, and not quite, because that’s silly. The\n                     guardians are both literally silent automatons, and not really, as there is indication through\n                     allusion they function as normal people too. And the kids went through a huge adventure, achieved\n                     immortal god status, and even then had to gain a few more levels just to gain the achievement of\n                     simple dialogue as a literal upgrade, as well as not literally, because that makes no sense. The\n                     reality is inseparable from the way the story is presented and the way the “game” is\n                     played.

You said once Act 6 would be shorter than Act 5,\n                     and that act 7 was pretty much the ending, but there seems to be so much plot to get through still.\n                     I guess I’m curious as to whether you think that your initial plan is still on tracks in that\n                     sense, or if homestuck might end up even longer? (not that i’m hoping or anything\n                     :P) </em><br/><br/>A6 will probably still be shorter than A5. But it could wind up being close.<br/><br/>It\n                     all depends on the approach, and generally, how leisurely I am about its construction. As a rule,\n                     the more leisurely the pace, the more diversions and detours and experimentation and silly messing\n                     around there is, and the more it all expands. If I stuck to a “just the facts” approach,\n                     it would be quite a bit shorter than A5. But then, that’s actually harder. Because that’s\n                     compressing major story hurdles, major productions like animations and stuff, into a smaller amount\n                     of time. It’s let’s conducive to steady consistent output. Economy, for me, for this\n                     project, in many ways is MORE difficult. So it’s more likely it’ll stretch out, and be\n                     roughly on par with A5. <br/><br/>AUGH I blew the H rule again.

(Wait, <a href=\"/faqs/science\" target=\"_blank\">this\n                     silly thing</a> is a better link)<br/><br/>Quick answer B: GAGS AHOY. We just saw robo-me\n                     holding a nanosecond stopwatch, with the hand whipping around at about 0.3C, then I ran over and\n                     threw a curtain over the walls before time was up. This sure is some ridiculous bullshit in here. If\n                     the intent of a “minimally” meddlesome author is, for smarter or dumber, to give these\n                     heroes a three year “catch up journey” of quiet downtime, what better place to cram\n                     those years than into the space of 3 nanoseconds? Or better yet, what more HILARIOUS place? Q E\n                     motherfuckin D.<br/><br/>Answer that is full of questions, a.k.a. PEDANTBUSTER_XXX: Are we really\n                     THAT far from the situation being physically reconcilable in some way? How much do we actually know\n                     about the situation? What are the scales and magnitudes here? How small are they? Is everything\n                     rendered to scale from my vantage, or is that more symbolic? What does shrinking something to do the\n                     physics? Are the two frames of reference physically commutable? Are there things about my universe\n                     that differ from the one they just exited, and they continue to abide? Jade did just call this a\n                     “realm with unusual spatial properties” after all. There is so much we don’t know\n                     about the situation, it’s impossible to make a ruling based on hard science alone. <br/><br/>The\n                     because AH’s author insert says so answer: AH said he would limit his intervention to the\n                     space of one yard and the duration of three nanoseconds, and so far he has lived up to that promise.\n                     And bearing in mind that he also at the very least COSPLAYS as a hero of space, it would seem his\n                     intervention might include purposefully stretching the amount of space they have to traverse, from\n                     their perpective. In other words, while I did promise to influence the story over only 1 yard and 3\n                     ns, I didn’t say it would also be 1 yard and 3 ns IN THEIR RELATIVISTIC FRAME OF REFERENCE!\n                     (It’s the oldest gotcha in the book!!!) They are actually getting jerked around to the tune of\n                     3 lightyears and 3 years. Does this seem like outrageous chicanery from an author insert claiming\n                     minimal intervention? Yes. But if such divine meddling is inappropriate here, where a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina\" target=\"_blank\">towering\n                     mechanical avatar of an author-god</a> stands present, then where is it appropriate? Nowhere is\n                     where. And maybe… just maybe… nowhere <em>IS</em> where.<br/><br/>Regardless, if you\n                     accept that answer, all that’s left to explain is the author’s motivation for doing so,\n                     which brings me to my final answer and also<br/><br/>The real answer: Homestuck-time and real-time\n                     have always been married in a strange way. I started it on 4/13/09, and by my own rule, that became\n                     locked in as the date in the story too. And then it became stuck there, for one day of\n                     Homestuck-time, while real-time flowed normally for two and a half years. When they scratched the\n                     game and reset the universe, it was time for me to start over too. So again by my own rule, I put up\n                     the first pages of the new story and grafted the story date to the real date, 11/11/11. The new\n                     kids, in a way, have been waiting almost 3 years since the beginning of Homestuck to take their\n                     place in the story, and have aged accordingly. They have done their time in the shadows, living\n                     uneventfully. And now the stated objective of the original kids is to join the new game. It is\n                     apparently John and Jade’s turn to wait, in sort of a prolonged narrative hybernation, while\n                     we spend time expanding on the new kids and their Very Long Day. If they are to eventually meet, it\n                     will be as approximate equals in age, and no, not so that everybody can get busy kissin’ or\n                     whatever. For more fundamental reasons, that have to do with the way HS-time relates to real-time,\n                     and essentially repairing the schism between these two clocks which resulted from the fact that\n                     about 24 hours of story took nearly three years to make.<br/><br/>And understanding that, I think\n                     the explanation that works best is not necessarily a physical, relativistic one, but more of a\n                     metaphysical idea. That when they crashed through the wall, they have presumably entered the real\n                     world, albeit for only 1 yard from our vantage. They have gone from HS-time to real-time. Given the\n                     schism between clocks, you could say they are faced with a rush of lost time, all at once. Like\n                     massive temporal wind resistance. So in crossing the yellow yard, they are forced to live every\n                     second that passed here in the real world which they did not experience in their fictional\n                     adventure. It’s the toll they have to pay before breaking through the other side and joining\n                     the others. <br/><br/>As I said, this is the explanation I prefer. But there are a bunch of ways to\n                     approach the issue.<br/><br/>Back to H questions.\n                  </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p><em><a class=\"amischiefofmice\" href=\"/tumblr/amischiefofmice\">amischiefofmice asked:</a></em><br/><em>Do you dare to give an estimate to how much more homestuck we\n                     have left? </em><br/><br/>If A6 is as long as A5, then an upper bound of 1.5 more years. <br/><br/>If\n                     A7 is ___ then an upper bound of ___.<br/><br/>Was that helpful?\n                  </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>-<br/><em><a class=\"animatedscreenshots\" href=\"/tumblr/animatedscreenshots\">animatedscreenshots asked:</a></em><br/><em>LORD ENGLISH = FIDUSPAWN??

It\n                     was becoming sort of intense getting one or more albums ready for release every month. It also did start\n                     to feel like <em>maybe</em> just a little bit too much music coming at you all the time. I’d like\n                     to make sure the novelty of these doesn’t deteriorate too quickly. Hence a single release seemed\n                     like a nice way to mix it up for now.

For the next album, I thought it would be fun to open the \n                     music submissions up to everybody.\n                  </p>\n<p>There seems to be a large \n                     number of musicians in the readership outside the music team, who often \n                     work on their own HS fan music or remixes. I’ve had quite a number of \n                     people express interest in submitting music to HS over the years, but to\n                     keep the team from ballooning out of control, I’ve had to draw the \n                     recruitment line somewhere. This strikes me as a nice opportunity to \n                     give a lot of other creative people a chance to contribute music. The \n                     music team was originally assembled just before HS began with the idea \n                     that I wanted MSPA stories to largely build and develop through \n                     contribution from the readership, and I think this album idea is very \n                     much in the spirit of that original premise.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>The challenge</strong></p>\n<p>If\n                     you want to submit music, the idea is simple. Pick a character from \n                     Homestuck, and make a song for that character. It can be any character, \n                     particularly those in identifiable categories, like the eight human \n                     kids, the trolls, ancestors, agents, exiles, Midnight Crew, Felt. If you\n                     want to pick a character not in one of those groups, that’s fine too. \n                     Keep in mind there’s a decent chance that if your song is picked, it \n                     could be reallocated to a different character, since it’s expected we’ll\n                     get a lot of submission overlap, and it’s not going to be “The Album of\n                     50 Karkat Songs!” So picking a character for your song is just a \n                     starting point for you, and we’ll sort it all out during the selection \n                     process.\n                  </p>\n<p>You can submit up to three songs. No more than that, or \n                     they will not be considered! They can be for three different characters,\n                     or the same character, whatever you want. You can do remixes, etc. of \n                     other HS songs, but we’ll have to run it by the original artist, and \n                     they’ll have some stake in the song’s sales. Attach MP3 files in an \n                     email to the address provided below before the deadline. Do not send WAV\n                     files! Too big. If your song is picked, we will contact you and ask for\n                     the high quality file.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Those details again</strong></p>\n<p>- Pick a Homestuck character<br/>- Make a song for that character<br/>- Submit up to 3 songs (for different characters if you like)<br/>- Attach MP3 files to email (no WAVs!)<br/>- We’ll get back to you asking for a high quality file if your song is picked</p>\n<p>I\n                     am hoping to include as much artist diversity as possible in the final \n                     list. Ideally, one artist per song. So while you may submit up to 3, if \n                     one of your songs is picked, it’ll likely be only one. If you have a lot\n                     of music you’re dying to send, hopefully the 3 song max will mitigate \n                     any agonizing decisions over which to send.\n                  </p>\n<p><strong>Submission</strong></p>\n<p>Send submission emails to:</p>\n<p><span class=\"go\">homestuckmusic@gmail.com</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"go\">The deadline is 6 weeks from now, on <strong>2/13/12</strong>. The album will be released two weeks after that.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"go\"><strong>The Prize</strong><br/></span></p>\n<p>If\n                     your song is picked, it will be included with the album! That’s pretty \n                     much the extent of the prize. You’ll get a cut of the album sales, in \n                     proportion with how many songs you have in the album to the total number\n                     of songs.\n                  </p>\n<p>Also, if this contributes any motivation for you, I’m \n                     going to try to make a point of using at least one song from this album \n                     in a future animation.\n                  </p>\n<p>I think that should be all the info you \n                     need to get started. Everybody is already super psyched to hear what you\n                     come up with.

The one syllable kid names were a\n                     result of smaller sample size + coincidence. One syllable was never a rule, only a superficial\n                     trend.

I haven’t been to one since… I think TCAF, last May?<br/><br/>Which\n                     is to my regret. I’d like to go to more. Frequent traveling is \n                     difficult and disruptive though. Hopefully I will do a fair number this \n                     year, probably beginning with TCAF again as luck would have it. Though \n                     something I have to weigh about that and events like it is how much I \n                     want to risk turning a mild Toronto library into a rabid den of \n                     outlandishly dressed teens. I’m not really sure the show’s organizers \n                     had that in mind when they cooked it up. I also seem to get a lot of \n                     invites to Anime cons now. As in, a quantity of invites FAR EXCEEDING \n                     the number of anime cons I thought existed. So I don’t know, maybe I’ll \n                     do… one or two of those? That seems to be my wheelhouse now, or at least\n                     is the wheelhouse my readers would like me to have. The animes \n                     wheelhouse. It could be fun doing an anime con in a sort of “WOW I SURE \n                     DON’T BELONG HERE!” kind of way.<br/><br/>But to answer the actual \n                     question, I’m perfectly fine encountering people in costumes. It’s fun, \n                     and they’re usually nice and friendly people.<br/><br/>The perception from\n                     my vantage may shift somewhat as the sheer magnitude of these swarms \n                     increases. Not necessarily in a bad way though. But really, what \n                     conceivable reaction to such hordes can a human have other than some \n                     form of disbelief? Something along the lines of “Wow, that SURE IS a \n                     herd of fifty Nepetas there. That is just like… a LOT of fucking \n                     Nepetas.”<br/>-<br/>-<br/><em><a class=\"arthurpendletonpillywig\" href=\"/tumblr/arthurpendletonpillywig\">arthurpendletonpillywig asked:</a></em><br/><em>What’s the relationship status between you and North?

Can you give us a hint on what that entails?</em><br/><br/>That\n                     was already explained pretty clearly I think. John and Jade ride across\n                     the yellow yard, and coexist in my universe for that exact distance. \n                     One yard relative to me, not them! I have said that you could also view \n                     it that the exact nature of my interference over this distance was to \n                     make it a much longer journey for them. You could view it that way, \n                     because it is true.<br/><br/>But this reminds me of a sort of “FAQ” which I’ve read in places sometimes but never addressed. It is basically:<br/><br/>“If one yard is your only influence, why did you kill Doc Scratch and rip off his leg? Isn’t that influencing stuff?”<br/><br/>No,\n                     because I didn’t kill him. This was also explained. When in my \n                     proximity, he goes unconscious like a reverse Calvin and Hobbes deal. \n                     Then I left, and he stayed asleep for just a little while, until the \n                     conditions for LE’s arrival were met. Then LE busted out of him, thus \n                     killing Scratch, fulling his claim that he needs to be dead for LE to \n                     arrive. Because his arrival itself is what kills him! This would have \n                     happened regardless, and my involvement affected nothing at all. Maybe \n                     if he wasn’t unconscious, he might have refreshed the scotty dog bowl \n                     once or twice while waiting around to become LE, and that’s it.<br/><br/>Ripping\n                     his leg off didn’t affect anything either. LE has a peg leg regardless.\n                     It’s a feature of his appearance, not a consequence of Scratch losing a\n                     leg. When I ripped his leg off, that was just another one of these \n                     serendipitous maimings you see here and there. Like how Vriska lost an \n                     arm and an eye, and so did Spades Slick, to echo the kid session \n                     prototypings. There’s no cause and effect here. It’s a recurring cosmic \n                     coincidence.<br/>-<br/>-<br/>-<br/>This reminds me of another one of these common FAQs I’ve never talked about. I’ll answer that one, then stop!<br/><br/>“Scratch said doomed timeline Vriska killed Bec Noir. Was she really that strong???”<br/><br/>First, time to get all the facts straight.<br/><br/>Scratch\n                     didn’t know if she won or lost. All he said was, though it would be a \n                     good fight and she’s probably outclassed, he wouldn’t bet against her. \n                     And why would he? Everything we’ve been shown about her suggests she \n                     always seems to find a way to come out on top, even if things look bad \n                     for her, or it seems like “karma” should prevent her victory. Mix in her\n                     dice roll powerup, her great luck, and who knows?<br/><br/>But let’s \n                     assume she did beat him for a second. Is this actually unthinkable, when\n                     you really break it down and examine it through video game logic?<br/><br/>She is:<br/>1) A god tier player, perhaps a number of tiers higher than base level. By how many is anyone’s guess.<br/>2) Extremely lucky, at the EXPENSE of her opponent’s luck, by way of her power.<br/>3) Most important of all: she rolled 8 8’s on her dice.<br/><br/>Think\n                     about the last point. Imagine in an RPG, a probability based attack, \n                     where the strongest one had a 1 in 16,777,216 chance to be used, every \n                     time you tried it? If you tried using this attack once every second, you\n                     wouldn’t be likely to hit the jackpot for 194 days!!! This must be a \n                     ridiculously strong attack. It was the one used to kill the black king, \n                     and that was before she even got the exp. for doing so.<br/><br/>Think of \n                     it as you would an ultimate upgrade in a game. Like a Mario star. Sure, \n                     Bowser is way stronger than Mario. But if he gets that star, all bets \n                     are off! It is a completely absurd advantage she’s afforded by that dice\n                     roll, which is only made possible through her great luck. Her power \n                     complemented her personality, which was that of a born cheater. The only\n                     problem was, her advantages didn’t matter in a doomed timeline. That \n                     wasn’t how things were supposed to go. If she beat him, he wouldn’t have\n                     killed the big frog, the green sun wouldn’t exist, and none of this \n                     ever gets started.<br/><br/>But is it at least plausible that she won? I \n                     don’t see why not. The fact that it was a close match actually says as \n                     much about how strong Jack is as it does about her, when you take into \n                     account all these insane upgrades she had.<br/><br/>scroll<br/><br/>scroll<br/><br/>scrollllllllllllll<br/><br/>These questions are forver.

An average looking,\n                     suburban, middle class household, run by a generic looking business man\n                     father who smokes a pipe. Culturally, there is plenty about this \n                     situation that says “white America”. But citing any of this as strong \n                     proof that they’re white is what’s racist. Are you saying a Hispanic \n                     family couldn’t find themselves in this situation, in either this \n                     universe or the non-fictionalized US? Are you saying a black kid \n                     wouldn’t behave like John? Or an Asian man couldn’t possibly style \n                     himself as a throwback era father? What exactly are you saying here?\n                  </p>\n<p>Let’s\n                     pretend I’m coming out and saying John is Asian for a minute. What can \n                     you supply to refute this? Does your argument boil down to, “Come on \n                     Hussie, the cultural clues to a white family are all there. You’re being\n                     disingenuous. If you wanted to indicate he was Asian, you’d have left \n                     some clue.” So my question is, what clues could I possibly leave to this\n                     effect? Maybe make him good at math?? I’m frankly drawing a blank at \n                     even facetious possibilities. What racial clues, when absent, prove they\n                     must not be a certain race? Does the absence of African tribal masks \n                     littered around the house prove beyond a shadow of a doubt they aren’t \n                     black? Or is it just they fact they don’t live in a ghetto that rules \n                     that out?? Really, this entire line of thinking, i.e. looking for \n                     “supporting evidence”, is implicitly racist.\n                  </p>\n<p>If you think I’m \n                     being disingenuous and pulling this a-racial thing out of nowhere, this \n                     is what I’ve always said since the beginning. People wondered about \n                     race, and I said the answer was N/A. These are templatized characters, \n                     and while many aspects of the comic are vibrantly colored, their skin \n                     tone is religiously left blank. Blank not as in white, per se, but as \n                     non-affiliated, as if they were lifted from a coloring book. It is this \n                     way because abstraction rules this universe absolutely. Abstraction \n                     rules their identities, the way they’re named, the qualities of their \n                     guardians, the way they pick up objects, the way they engage in \n                     dialogue, and everything about the game they play.\n                  </p>\n<p>It is also a \n                     heavily templatized story universe. The notion of “character” in \n                     Homestuck is a highly malleable construct, as it is in certain games. So\n                     much of HS and Sburb is designed with EXTREME flexibility in mind. It’s\n                     designed to have your imagination fill in gaps, and expand the universe\n                     far beyond the boundaries of what happens in the story. Everything was \n                     built with this in mind. The alchemy system, to get you to wonder what \n                     items you’d make. The prototyping system, to get you to wonder what sort\n                     of quest you’d build for yourself. What planets might your session \n                     have? What god tier titles? Are there more than what’s shown? You’re \n                     always being invited to ask by the systems that are introduced, what \n                     more is possible through this? This was a deliberate feature of HS built\n                     in from the start. It was a guiding principle for its construction, and\n                     still is. I’m sure it’s a <em>very major</em> reason why it’s captured a\n                     lot of imaginations. So in this medium of intrinsic abstraction and \n                     malleability, if you’re suggesting it’s somehow flimsy or weak to not \n                     offer an iron clad ruling on something so trivial as race, I’m going to \n                     suggest you are very badly NOT GETTING IT.\n                  </p>\n<p>And to actually get <em>indignant</em>\n                     at the suggestion that race is canonically non-applicable, because you \n                     think it’s JUST SO OBVIOUS all these kids are white? That’s the ugliness\n                     of bigotry surfacing. Bigotry not only blinds you to ways you are in \n                     error, but triggers an automated response of anger to differing points \n                     of view. And then you don’t even realize that’s what happened. It’s not a\n                     great way to be.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/non-reblogged-reblog\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on January 16th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

And it definitely was \n                     hilarious. I understand that not everyone thinks all of my e-impulses \n                     are a total riot though.\n                  </p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>Before I launch into any more of this, let me reframe the key points which drove the previous post.</p>\n<p>-\n                     You can absolutely craft an argument using story data that the kids are\n                     white. You are allowed to believe they’re white! That’s cool. I’m not \n                     saying that makes you a racist at all. Often I view them that way \n                     myself, if bothering to imagine them corporeally. I’ve also pictured \n                     John and Jade as Asian and thought, “that works.” These are just \n                     personal reflections and you’re free to form your own by any criteria, \n                     including hyperfidelity to canon minutia, <em>as well as by disregarding one or two ridiculously insignificant points of said minutia</em>. You have my permission. But most of the time I picture them as N/A, and my official answer when asked is “I don’t care.”\n                  </p>\n<p>- What does strike me as racist is when someone gets <em>angry </em>over\n                     the suggestion that they could be thought of as anything other than \n                     white. And that does appear to be a thing that happens. It’s a position \n                     that irritates me. Enough to bother addressing it, and verbally \n                     crystallize some points on abstraction as they apply to race in HS, even\n                     if in apparent contradiction with one or two minor story details.\n                  </p>\n<p>That’s pretty much the bottom line on this.</p>\n<p>It’s\n                     aggravating to imagine a guy getting in someone’s grill about how \n                     there’s NO WAY John and Jade could be Asian kids or something, because \n                     some canon savant can cite an excerpt in the 300K word barrage of \n                     Homestuck which refers to the group of infants as pink monkeys. That \n                     isn’t really cutting it for me as a sticking point. Should we get out \n                     the pantone swatchbook, and verify that all non-white babies shall never\n                     exhibit anything like a rosy hue? Or failing that, what if some babies \n                     there were white and others weren’t? Digging even this much into it is \n                     already sort of treading too far into the pedantic bullshitification of \n                     the topic. Would submitting a “my bad” on that phrase choice help \n                     deflect some antagonization toward those with a different view? Cause I \n                     can do that. I can cough up a my bad once in a while. In fact I think I \n                     just did!\n                  </p>\n<p>The retcon gibberish, I think we can safely TL;DR as “another fuckup.”</p>\n<p>I do feel it’s all a little more complicated than it looks though.</p>\n<p>I\n                     dropped the gibberish in place of the word “white” as a flippant \n                     faux-rebuttal to the obvious gotcha it represents. It was one of the \n                     earlier rambling dialogues where John alluded to Dave’s bro as a lame \n                     white rapper.\n                  </p>\n<p>First of all, here’s what’s true: I was being quite \n                     serious when I said I viewed these kids as non-racial from the start. It\n                     is a fact! In the earliest pages, when people asked what race they \n                     were, I just said “N/A.” “Don’t care.” “You decide.”\n                  </p>\n<p>But the thing\n                     is, this position had so much more to do with adhering to the \n                     fundamental abstraction in this world than it had to do with making any \n                     sort of statement on racial harmony or anything like that. The point was\n                     never to make something perfectly air-tight in terms of racial \n                     neutrality, as a means to create some sort of socially conscious \n                     advocacy literature. If it was, I probably would have been more alert in\n                     those early stages to make dead certain little tipoffs on race didn’t \n                     bleed into the story during some of the more outrageous, off-the-cuff \n                     character rants.\n                  </p>\n<p>That’s the thing, especially in a lot of those \n                     earlier dialogues, I was somewhat less diabolically all-calculating than\n                     I became over time. In early chats I was more likely to flip on the \n                     “ridiculous rant” switch, and just write stuff that struck me as funny. \n                     It was just a funny thing for John to say about bro, which for the \n                     moment punctured that membrane between the way I was personally \n                     picturing a character for the sake of comedy, from these fairly \n                     amorphous rules of abstraction I established at the beginning. TL;DR, a \n                     fuckup. Then I kept making pages, kinda forgot about it, and am pretty \n                     sure never once used a racial qualifier that specific again. And I \n                     didn’t really care, because, and this is the important point here: <em>it just doesn’t matter.</em>\n</p>\n<p>And I could just “whoops” and again indicate how trivial and isolated it was and move on, but there’s even more to it than that!</p>\n<p>At\n                     that point in the story, I’m quite sure I hadn’t determined that bro \n                     was Dave’s biological father. I sure as hell didn’t know Dirk would \n                     become a “playable character” some day (i.e. literally yesterday). So \n                     many aspects of this story were all coalescing gradually, and that even \n                     includes the extent to which race was a reliable ambiguity. That wobbled\n                     a couple times, but otherwise has stayed consistently unmentioned over \n                     the haul of several thousand pages. On that page, their whole \n                     ectobiological origin hadn’t even been conceived. Concepts like that \n                     were a work in progress. When the story began, Dave was just some kid \n                     being raised by some dude. That was as deep as I wanted the explanation \n                     to go, until further notice.\n                  </p>\n<p>But let’s say you’re super bent on \n                     taking that retconned tidbit to heart. So, ok, Dirk is white, which \n                     means… what? Dave and Rose are at least half white? Alrighty, so be it! \n                     Don’t care enough to dispute the factmasters, if they’re immune to a \n                     nuanced explanation.\n                  </p>\n<p>What I will dispute is this chain of \n                     conclusions. Dirk = white, ergo Dave + Rose = white, ergo all 8 kids = \n                     white, because I MEAN COME ON, WE BOTH KNOW THEY’RE ALL WHITE, BECAUSE \n                     THAT’S WHAT YOU WERE GETTING AT HERE, AND ALL THE “ENDORSED CAUCASIAN \n                     FANART”, AND THE PINK BABIES, AND COME OOOOON ARE YOU SHITTING ME. No, \n                     that conclusion is wrong. And the bluster behind it is……… offensive!\n                  </p>\n<p>If\n                     you want to back me into a corner on every last angle of this, and for \n                     instance bring up the example of how, say, an African American Rose is a\n                     “tough sell”? Ok, yes. I will be reasonable. I will agree that an \n                     African American Rose is probably kind of a tough sell for most people. I\n                     still just say, so what? Why even bother with ruling out that \n                     particular exception? If you want to repudiate people who draw her that \n                     way or something, go ahead. I’m not going to, because I don’t give a \n                     fuck. I’ll again just say N/A.\n                  </p>\n<p>I probably won’t leave the retcon \n                     gibberish there forever. But I might leave it there until people stop \n                     giving a shit about this.\n                  </p>\n<p>I’ll do one of three things.</p>\n<p>1) Keep it forever, because: I don’t care.<br/>2)\n                     Change it back to white, because: I still don’t really give a shit \n                     about the mild, singular, isolated contradiction it represents.<br/>3) Revise the sentence to read more naturally and exclude the word white because: I don’t give a fuck.\n                  </p>\n<p>Some\n                     people I think regarded my flippant retcon as a needless escalation of \n                     this to something like a “really big deal.” Dunno about that. So I stuck\n                     a garbage word into one marginal conversation 4000 pages deep in the \n                     archive? OH NOES. Story pollution. What if he never fixes it??????\n                  </p>\n<p>I\n                     tend to be a little flippant with my own story, even where others \n                     perceive hallowed ground. It’s practically business as usual.\n                  </p>\n<p>FINAL TLDR YO</p>\n<p>There’s\n                     only one thing I’m annoyed about, and only one type of behavior I’m \n                     calling racist. And that is if you act all haughty and shit on people \n                     about how they absolutely have to believe all these kids are white. \n                     That’s it. It’s cool if you believe they’re white. I can’t blame you for\n                     that perception at all.\n                  </p>\n<p>Happy Martin Luther king day everybody!</p>\n<p>I really didn’t plan on gettin into all this on MLK2KXII.

It doesn’t even matter if the character is <a href=\"/mspa/006375\" target=\"_self\">someone in a\n                     fictional book</a> within the story. Actually, that probably only encourages it, since the vague\n                     allusions to a much bigger story tend to capture people’s imaginations and get people drawin’.\n                     And so there was this whole rash of cool Calmasis interpretations after that update. Not sure how to\n                     point you to the preponderance of this work, other than vaguely suggest you look up the #calmasis\n                     tag??\n                  </p>\n<p>Pronouns</p>\n<p>Probably most people regard s/he as a highly utilitarian concatenation for use when gender is\n                     unknown, if somewhat awkward. It does carry the advantage that everyone understands what you’re\n                     getting at. In this case we have no idea at all what Calmasis’ situation is. The narrative\n                     obviously leaves details of the book wide open. “Androgynous” is a broad term. Calmasis\n                     could identify as a specific gender, without having it revealed by him/her, or by the story for\n                     whatever reason. Or the character could be of an actual non-binary gender. We have no idea. We haven’t\n                     peeked inside the book to get a sense of this. Maybe at some point we will.\n                  </p>\n<p>For those of non-binary gender, “s/he” can come off as dismissive, since it implies one\n                     or the other. Probably not all that many people are even aware of the array of neutral pronouns that\n                     are available, like ze or ne or <a href=\"http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2079\" target=\"_blank\">THON</a>. I’d bet the number of people\n                     unfamiliar with them is quite staggering, which makes it all the more difficult to assimilate any\n                     into language, or just drop them into a sentence casually. Pronouns are really fundamental units of\n                     communication too, so if you swap one for a strange word people don’t know, it really throws\n                     them for a loop. But hey, I’m down with the idea. English has been lumbering along without\n                     neutral pronouns for too many centuries already. They have loads more applications than just\n                     referencing people of certain gender identities.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/thar-ze-blows\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on January 24th, 2012</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

I update \n                     frequently but by the standards of readers’ humongous appetites for \n                     more, the rate of progress is still glacial. There are things like \n                     animation time to factor in, drawing lots more new “plot advancing \n                     assets,” juggling a bunch of different story threads and so on. It’s a \n                     slow, steady creep, but it’s always going somewhere, and that \n                     destination has become reliably combustible.<br/><br/>\n                     But making decisions to accelerate your plans \n                     because people are impatient is the same thing as making bad decisions. \n                     To put everything in perspective, think of it this way. Cascade didn’t \n                     happen 4 months ago. It happened about an hour ago, or maybe less. \n                     Because that’s how long it takes to read what I’ve written since then. \n                     It’s almost nothing. No matter what doldrums we appear to progress \n                     through serially, or what elusive payoffs seem to perpetually hover in \n                     the distance, all of that is insignificant and easily endured in the \n                     archival readthrough by the wide eyed and uninitiated. One who watched \n                     Cascade an hour ago is propelled through succeeding material still \n                     spurred by the energy and curiosity generated by that explosive \n                     multi-threaded plot crescendo. And if Homestuck were finished, they’d \n                     just keep reading to the end without handwringing over who’s gonna be \n                     introduced when or wondering why teen drama has replaced “real plot \n                     advancement” or stuff like that, because they don’t have time to form \n                     those thoughts because there’s always another page to click on. All \n                     those things are quickly contextualized and paid off because you just \n                     keep clicking next, while all the entertainment value is heavily \n                     compactified, easily compensating for the kinds of lulls or buildup \n                     measures that can absolutely torment some serial readers and push them \n                     to the threshold of bizarre histrionics and irrational ragequit oaths.<br/><br/>\n                     Wait, I’ve wandered into the serial vs. archival \n                     reading issue again. This isn’t even all that pertinent to the question.\n                     But it’s a topic I seem to get into a lot because it’s important, maybe\n                     even THE most important consideration for how a story is perceived, \n                     i.e. the rate at which it’s absorbed. Few seem to understand this. And \n                     those who do often forget, and get caught up in kneejerk judgments that \n                     would never be made otherwise. It kind of blows my mind observing some \n                     of the reactionary dementia that crops up in a huge serial readership, \n                     which is a double edged sword: fun to watch the day-to-day excitement \n                     over developments, painful to behold the ubiquitous impatience and the \n                     corrupting influence that has on the judgment of content. In many \n                     respects it’s a very bad way to read a longform story, dribbled out in \n                     pages rather than in big chunks. Impatience among some generates \n                     toxicity over time, like they’re gradually, unwittingly developing a \n                     grudge against the story because of the pace they’re forced to read at. \n                     This then warps everything they see. As if a tainted a witness. If they \n                     crave swift advancement, then pages that do not accomplish this \n                     adequately like gags or character developing interactions become like \n                     personal affronts to them. Good material is like a slap in the face. And\n                     the irony is, the more they like the story, the more toxic the attitude\n                     can get, because they badly want to see it get somewhere fast, and they\n                     can feel let down or like the work is in decline because they’re forced\n                     to sit through its responsible, judicious development in realtime. But \n                     this is an almost nonexistent phenomenon with archival reading, which \n                     lends itself to a little more detachment and reservation as one cruises \n                     through the material at the speed of reading. Judgments are formed less \n                     at the atomic level of the story’s building blocks, a bit more \n                     holistically, and individual developments are never agonized over. They \n                     may ultimately not love the story, but at least the resentment complex \n                     that can fester in the space of the serial drip never had a chance to \n                     skew the result.<br/><br/>\n                     Probably some people think it’s weird that I put \n                     emphasis on long term archival pacing when I produce a thing serially, \n                     page by page. I do think that is the only way to make something good in \n                     the long term. But aside from that, consider that by now the vast \n                     majority of the readership began reading relatively recently. Most \n                     current readers have experienced most of the story by catching up \n                     through the archives, so any attention I put on pacing that out with \n                     patience and discipline has directly benefited, it turns out: MOST \n                     READERS! This trend will probably continue as more pile on in the future\n                     and HS approaches its end. But then the funny thing is those people who\n                     catch up then dive into the huge serial mosh pit, and immediately \n                     assume the psychology and habits of serial readers, most of the time \n                     without even being aware of how radically this will alter their \n                     perception of all events that follow, better or worse. It’s kind of a \n                     strange mill of human perception I’m running here. A weird factory where\n                     droves enter curious, proceed fascinated, and exit frenzied. But while \n                     that process for them is quick, they should try to remember the factory \n                     took three years to build, and its construction is ongoing at the same \n                     slow pace it always has been.\n                  </p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><em class=\"post18106704483q16\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post18106704483q16\">“Now\n                     that Jake and Jane are a official non-couple is Jake and Dirk going to \n                     be a couple and what will happen with Jane and Roxy?”</a></em><br/><br/>\n                     I couldn’t quite follow your question because I was \n                     too distracted by drawing Jane and Roxy making out for the next 500 \n                     pages.\n                  </p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>.</p>\n<p><em class=\"post18106704483q17\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post18106704483q17\">“today\n                     i got my wisdom teeth out and i was awake the whole time and the only \n                     thing that got me through it was the happiness from the fact that for at\n                     least one day, dirkjake was canon. thank you”</a></em><br/><br/>\n                     I still have my wisdom teeth and they’ll probably \n                     have to be removed at some point before I die.

It’s kind of bombastic, \n                     character-aggrandizing, uncomfortably erotic, and florid. I wanted to \n                     leverage the Bad Fanfiction Zone for useful story purposes, primarily \n                     because this was a funny idea to me. It’s one of those gags which I \n                     don’t expect the majority of readers to pick up on. Some people LOVE the\n                     Mindfang stuff because, among other reasons, they’re often the sort of \n                     people who genuinely like to read fanfiction! Whereas some others HATED \n                     the journals, probably without even fully understanding why. The reason \n                     is because I bombed my own story with bad fanfiction, and tricked them \n                     into reading it. This is absolutely the most hilarious consequence of \n                     this gag.<br/><br/>\n                     But don’t get me wrong. Just because I call it the \n                     Bad Fanfiction Zone doesn’t mean I actually think the Mindfang stuff is \n                     bad. All the lore is good and I like the indirect filling in of events \n                     and details of alien culture as you’d reveal through study of historical\n                     documents and journals. But the execution is humorously heavy handed, \n                     somewhere between lavish old world prose and an enthusiastic fandom \n                     hackjob, and this was a conscious layer of the gag.

My \n                     follow-up advice on this is very simple: educate yourself.<br/><br/>Invisible\n                     Children has done a good job in getting your attention, and inspiring \n                     people. But like any call to activism or charitable action, it should be\n                     your invitation to research the topic more carefully, and decide what \n                     to do from a fully informed standpoint.<br/><br/>There are <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html\" target=\"_blank\">counterpoints</a> to the message of the video. (Some <a href=\"http://visiblechildren.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">serious critiques</a>, and <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/www.invisiblechildren.com/critiques.html\" target=\"_blank\">IC’s response</a>.)\n                     The issues surrounding aid to Africa, especially those tangled up with \n                     its political landscape, are very complicated. They should be examined \n                     carefully before making charitable gestures indiscriminately. There are \n                     indications that Invisible Children, while well intended, may not be the\n                     most effective vehicle for your donations. If this is true, I don’t \n                     think it should be used as a basis to smear the group, or to be cynical \n                     about their motives necessarily. They did something good. They got your \n                     attention, and got people talking about something important. But then \n                     the rest is up to you, to pursue this intelligently and examine the \n                     facts. <br/><br/>I’m not gonna turn this blog into any sort of hub for \n                     education on this issue, or point you to a ton of reading material. All \n                     that stuff is out there for you to find, through news articles, tumblr \n                     exchanges and whatnot. I’m just offering a very simple reminder. Do your\n                     homework before getting too swept up in something you don’t fully \n                     understand.\n                  </p>\n<p>** edit: deleted original post.

MSPA has made it through the first few rounds and\n                     now things are really “heating up.” I think there is a cash prize \n                     involved. $100 for winning, unless I just imagined reading that \n                     somewhere. I think If MSPA wins, I’ll just buy a $100 gift certificate \n                     to the Olive Garden and give it away to a random reader. Wait, does that\n                     count as a bribe? Some may argue it actually serves as a <a href=\"/tumblr/land-of-souls-and-olives-a-conclusion-pasta-la-vista\" target=\"_blank\">strong deterrent</a>. Hold the phone, it looks like I was the one who argued that??\n                  </p>\n<p>Looks like some other good comics are still in the running too. Consider giving <a href=\"http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gunnerkrigg Court</a>\n                     a vote, or at least a read. It’s in a close race with Penny Arcade. I \n                     like PA, but 50 million people read it already. GKC is a good story \n                     which could use some more attention.\n                  </p>\n<p>All the other races are either runaways or ones I could go either way on. Too bad <a href=\"http://qwantz.com/index.php\">Qwantz</a>\n                     got knocked out already. It looked like North and I were on a collision\n                     course for a while there. We could have had our own personal Hunger \n                     Games moment. Just the two of us with our poison berries, standing in \n                     defiance of the cruel fuckers who would pit us against each other. I.e. \n                     you people.\n                  </p>\n<p>Oh yeah…</p>\n<p>The album. Remember that?</p>\n<p>Honestly\n                     I’m not even sure what’s going on with it right now. It’s hung up on \n                     some legal minutia for the time being. There are more than twice as many\n                     people involved as the previous biggest album, and all of them are new,\n                     so there’s a lot to sort out. It’s like 99.999% done, but you know how \n                     it goes. That last 0.001% can drag on for weeks. Or maybe you don’t know\n                     how it goes? FYI, that’s how it goes.\n                  </p>\n<p>It’s still around the corner though.

This was a little extra, \n                     since I had to do a lot of programming too. Kind of underestimated that,\n                     thinking “hell, it’s just a bunch of buttons and conditionals, how bad \n                     could it be?” Uhhh, no. Even a few puzzles here and there requires a \n                     much bigger footprint of internal logic and variables than you expect \n                     going into it. Mix in a bunch of different KINDS of work like all the \n                     art, writing, conceptualizing, and all the standard endless flash \n                     tweening bullshit, and that’s a pretty serious gauntlet to fit in a \n                     week. I actually had just a little more planned for it beyond the final \n                     door, but had to cut it off there for now. (For one thing the file was \n                     getting too big.)\n                  </p>\n<p>There were a few bugs which I just fixed too. Like text clipping issues and stuff. Maybe try replaying if it was buggy for you.</p>\n<p>Or if you prefer to severely relax your brain cells rather than give them another workout, feel free to <a href=\"/sbahj/43\" target=\"_blank\">read this</a>.

So the appearance to the casual \n                     tumblr user scrolling through their feed is that I made a dumb post \n                     about dicks or memes or whatever.\n                  </p>\n<p>And of course because they see \n                     it on their dash people BELIEVE I made that inane original post without \n                     question and think, omg look at this weird outrageous thing Hussie said,\n                     and then THEY reblog it, and so on.\n                  </p>\n<p>You can verify whether the \n                     original author actually said what was reblogged by clicking on their \n                     name, but really, who on tumblr is ACTUALLY going to do that? This is \n                     not the most deeply inquiring, skeptical crowd we’re talking about. \n                     Tumblr users are essentially scrolling junkies. Next post next post next\n                     post ha ha “like” next next “ooh gonna reblog that” nextnextnextnext.\n                  </p>\n<p>I\n                     can’t change people’s behavior and I’m not telling people to stop this.\n                     Talk about a losing battle. I guess this is mostly addressed to the \n                     people who run tumblr, assuming they actually give a shit. Why even \n                     allow this nonsense through the design of your system? How hard would it\n                     be to code a stipulation that if the original content was changed by a \n                     reblogger, huge red text appeared over their post saying something like \n                     “THE CONTENT OF THE ORIGINAL POST HAS BEEN EDITED. YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK\n                     THE AUTHOR’S SITE TO VERIFY.” Hey I know the answer: not hard at all.\n                  </p>\n<p>Or\n                     maybe they don’t care about whether their social media site has the \n                     potential to be taken seriously as a means of distributing information \n                     by people or groups who give half a fuck about the authenticity of their\n                     widely proliferated messages. Maybe they’re fine with the whole thing \n                     deteriorating into incoherent memetic entropy that people can only \n                     tolerate if they’re really jonesing to banter about Doctor Who. Or is \n                     that what tumblr already is? Hey, maybe this is one reason why!!!\n                  </p>\n<p>Seriously\n                     tempted to stop using tumblr because of this. If counterfeit reblogging\n                     is going to turn into a “thing” why should I bother blogging anything \n                     at all?\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/reblog-fraud\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on April 15th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

WOW, nobody is sure what that means. Here we go…\n                  </p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q1\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q1\">What exactly determines whether a person is a Derse or Prospit dreamer? Or is it just random?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>I wouldn’t say random, but it’s certainly vague. I\n                     guess it’s a little like sorting hat logic in Harry Potter (which I \n                     have a really halfassed understanding of because I haven’t read it), but\n                     even more vague, and more binary.<br/><br/>\n                     You get some sense there is rhyme and reason to it \n                     when you look at the personality types of the two groups. John, Jade, \n                     Jake, Jane vs Rose, Dave, Dirk, Roxy. And the troll groups were divided \n                     by their teams, red vs blue. Blue team (Derse) was generally stocked \n                     with more scheming members. Red team (Prospit) had some more \n                     straightforward heroic types, at least as far as trolls go. But then \n                     there can be oddball designations that don’t seem to make sense by such \n                     simplistic parameters, like Vriska being on Prospit. If she and Nepeta \n                     were swapped the criteria might seem more clear cut. See again, sorting \n                     hat logic. Like I think Harry was supposed to be in Slytherin because he\n                     could talk snakes and was kind of moody and shit but he was just SO \n                     BRAVE and loved friendship SO MUCH he got put in the other one. But for \n                     real, my fanfic where he was a Slytherin all along is so much better. \n                     (he is naked in most of it)<br/><br/>\n                     You could also look to the passive/active nature of \n                     the classes in making some retroactive sense of the Derse/Prospit \n                     dreamer duality. Passive/active classes are also a pretty vague thing, \n                     and don’t resolve so easily into simple dualities like \n                     defensive/offensive and such. Those are the guidelines for understanding\n                     them, but there is clearly a lot of flexibility within that system. \n                     They seem to suggest tendencies rather than absolute capabilities. Like \n                     there isn’t a rule that says a passive class could never use an \n                     offensive technique. The system is meant to be very flexible, and in the\n                     story, classes suggest a little more about a hero’s path and role in \n                     the greater quest than what their battle capabilities are.<br/><br/>\n                     But if we’re saying active/passive literally \n                     translates to offensive/defensive for the sake of this topic, then Derse\n                     would be very active and Prospit would be very passive. Derse’s job is \n                     to attack. Prospit’s is to defend. This seems to carry over to the roles\n                     of the dreamers too. Dave and Rose turned out to be very active \n                     players. Dave time traveling all over the place, making a fortune on \n                     stocks and such. Rose went on her crazy solo mission to break the game \n                     and fight Jack. Jade and John had more passive roles through most of \n                     that, players who were “acted upon” by other players and circumstances. \n                     John was always being led around by trolls this way and that, drifting \n                     around wherever the wind took him. Jade was especially passive for a lot\n                     of the story, spending a lot of time falling asleep (or being put to \n                     sleep) at key moments. It wasn’t until she reached god tier as a Witch \n                     (said to be a highly active class) that she became extremely active, \n                     making lots of stuff happen, rounding up planets and all that. Rose may \n                     have been a similar case, being excessively active as a Derse dreamer, \n                     but then flipping over to a passive role upon reaching god tier as a \n                     passive class.<br/><br/>\n                     Being from Derse means you are from a culture of \n                     offense and aggression. Being from Prospit means the opposite. You could\n                     argue that these are qualities that either rub off on the dreamers, or \n                     they are designated as those dreamers in the first place because of \n                     those qualities. You could take the view that these are innate \n                     tendencies to overcome, as seemed to be the case for Jade and Rose. Or \n                     maybe sometimes they are tendencies that are resisted, and need to be \n                     understood and embraced. As a Prospit dreamer, did Karkat struggle \n                     because he was actually passive in nature, but had a very active self \n                     image as a leader and conqueror? Was Vriska an even more extreme case of\n                     misplaced active behavior from a Prospit dreamer? These are yet more \n                     things to consider when looking at everything contributing to the hero \n                     story of an individual in this game.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q2\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q2\">I\n                        hope this isn’t too plot-critical to answer. Will we be seeing more / \n                        learning about the Denizens? One of the biggest things that pulled me \n                        into Homestuck was the concept of the Denizens. These gigantic bosses \n                        that played into the game motif and the mythology of Homestuck. But \n                        then, just as they came, they went. Very little is mentioned about the \n                        Denizens, with only hints on to what their true nature is. We haven’t \n                        even gotten to see Jade interacting with Echidna, getting her Quills and\n                        agreeing on a plan to survive the scratch. This is easily one of the \n                        most important things that happens during Act 5 Act 2. So, in short, \n                        will we get to see and learn about the Denizens? Thanks Andrew!</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>Yes, this will be revisited later.<br/><br/></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q3\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q3\">Characters\n                        like Dirk and Dave have some sick rhymes. (Not to mention other \n                        examples like “And it Don’t Stop”) What is your process for writing \n                        these lyrical masterworks? Can you actually rap in real life?</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>I don’t think I have a process other than writing\n                     down stuff I think is funny, and also rhymes. Writing raps that appear \n                     as text in a story I think is pretty different from writing raps that \n                     work well in actual rap music. There are a lot of raps in the story that\n                     I think aren’t necessarily that well suited to being adapted to music. \n                     They might need some work. The purposes are different. A rap in a story \n                     is basically just more verbal entertainment. It rhymes, it has some sort\n                     of meter that’s either obvious or you have to think about a little to \n                     parse and come up with the right flow, and that’s it. Lyrics in an \n                     actual rap song have to mesh well with a beat and a whole lot of other \n                     song elements to work. Sometimes that even means sacrificing some \n                     coherence by story writing standards. There are plenty of killer raps \n                     out there that work well as songs, but if you took away the beat and \n                     music, and just printed the words in a story, they might seem flat or \n                     kind of odd or nonsensical just standing alone. Moral: song writing and \n                     story writing are really different animals.<br/><br/>\n                     I have never rapped in real life. I’m really not a \n                     performer of any sort, and don’t want to be. I’m more about coming up \n                     with ideas, quietly working at my computer making stuff. Anything that \n                     involves much outward projection from my physical manifestation, forget \n                     it. When a dude comes up with some sick rhymes and thinks he might be \n                     pretty awesome at rapping, I think that’s one of those classic \n                     delusional vanity-blunders to avoid. Me rapping = lame, trust me.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q4\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q4\">Do your parents read your comics? If so, what do they think about them?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>They both know about it and have read fairly \n                     significant chunks, but “Actively Reading It” as many people know is a \n                     whole can of worms. You have to be completely caught up, which is \n                     already pretty daunting, and need to remember and keep track of a lot of\n                     things for it to make sense on a day to day basis. The serial reading \n                     experience is a really tough thing to hang in there with over a long \n                     period of time for certain types of people, and I might put “parents” at\n                     the top of the list of those types of people. They’re also kind of old.\n                     Homestuck ain’t for old people. It’s dangerously close to not being for\n                     people my age either. It’s really easy to imagine a 30-something year \n                     old looking at it and saying “what the fuck is this? 5000 pages of kids \n                     arguing with each other? PASS.” Hell that might even be something I \n                     would say if I weren’t the guy making it. But young people read it and \n                     say “oh my god, i am these children. they are all me. especially \n                     nepeta.” My parents don’t look at MSPA and go “i am nepeta” just FYI.<br/><br/>\n                     I think my dad actually caught up with it fully \n                     about two years ago, when the archive was more manageable. He’s the sort\n                     who gets really hyperbolic about how great the things I do are, so I \n                     got a pretty good review from him. But then I had to wonder how much he \n                     actually understood. He started going on about how he really liked Rose,\n                     and kind of tried to name the things he liked about her, and it became \n                     clear he was actually referring to Jade the whole time.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q5\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q5\">I\n                        recently purchased and received Homestuck Volume 2 in the mail, and you\n                        make the point on several occasions that what is missed most in the \n                        transition to static page are not the big sweeping flash animations with\n                        their long tweens, but the gif panels, and their often quicker rhythm \n                        and way of showing content. Looking back quickly through recent updates,\n                        it seems like there’s a lot less of the kind of early gifs, with \n                        multiple captchalogue transfers, flashstepping, slowly floating towels, \n                        coiled springs, etc, and most of the animated gif panels recently have \n                        either just had chat icons bouncing a bit or other things like that \n                        which add a bit of visual interest, but are no real loss when made \n                        static, or cut be easily cut into two or three static panels without too\n                        much loss of flow or content.</a>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q5\">Basically, my \n                        long-winded question is this - is this an intentional shift in how \n                        you’ve been making gifs, in preparing for a book far down the line, or \n                        coincidence, or am i smoking the bargain crack?</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>Making less of those types of panels has a lot \n                     more to do with current granularity and scale of events being depicted. \n                     Early on, the focus was zoomed way in on those little actions, so there \n                     was more attention on showing each little animated sequence of picking \n                     objects up, using them, scurrying around and stuff like that. The more \n                     the story broadened, the less it made sense to put focus on those kinds \n                     of actions through short animated gifs. With broadened action and \n                     tightened pacing, the nature of the visuals tends to embrace more \n                     tradition sequential art values like in graphic novels, because that’s \n                     how those stories are usually paced. You don’t get the tight focus on \n                     such atomic actions like you deal with in a game. But I think that early\n                     animated gif style was revisited somewhat in the beginning of act 6, \n                     when for a little while that type of action returned. Then just like \n                     before the pacing started tightening up as things went along and we went\n                     back to more typical sequential art frames.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q6\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q6\">When\n                        a player reach God-tier, he is theoretically immortal.

Sometimes the game is running off model and serving some other \n                     weird purpose. The purpose of John’s game seemed to be “create a \n                     universe” but it turned out all along the hidden objective was “reset \n                     the game, get out of there, and take everything with you. and oh yeah \n                     make sure this huge bomb explodes in the middle of nowhere, that too”. \n                     It’s a strange game. There are as many ways to set up the variables, as \n                     many reasons for doing so, as many different kinds of heroes, quests, \n                     and objectives as there are stories to tell.<br/><br/>\n                     The last batch of questions is too complicated. It \n                     falls under “what was planned and when?” What is planning? What is a \n                     plan? Where does planning end and spontaneity begin?

See \n                     the first question, about active/passive duality and their correlation \n                     with Derse and Prospit dreamers, which was an invention that came long \n                     before god tier stuff.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q22\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q22\">You said that a trolls blood color relates to their lifespan, so what is the usual lifespan for each color in the main cast?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>We know Mindfang’s caste lives for what seems to \n                     be centuries from her journals.

I’m just going by what’s\n                     in the story, using a little logic, and thinking it out, which anyone \n                     can do.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q23\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q23\">Do\n                        you consider characters with traditional nicknames having those names \n                        as their full names? That is, is Dave’s name just “Dave”, or do you \n                        consider the characters actually being named David or Roxanne or \n                        Solluxander and so forth?</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br/>No, their names are their names.<br/><br/>\n                     Except Sollux, he really is Solluxander.<br/><br/>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"post25156009290q24\"><a href=\"/tumblr/post25156009290q24\">Is “Dirk raised himself” canon? I can’t see how that would be possible, should we assume he’s lying or is he really that badass?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is probably not possible in the real world. But as\n                     an adult, he stood on a meteor as it descended to Earth, and chopped it\n                     in half. As a baby, raising himself is a really minor feat in \n                     comparison. In that it is something that while far fetched, is actually \n                     in the realm of physical possibility.<br/><br/>\n                     This kind of exposes a funny thing about the \n                     suspension of disbelief. There are things we are very ready to suspend \n                     it for, even if they are laughably implausible. Like, sure it is absurd \n                     that he chopped a meteor in half. But it KICKED ASS! It gets a pass. But\n                     a baby raising himself on stockpiles of orange soda, the occasional \n                     fishing expedition, and teaching himself everything from the internet? \n                     That is just ludicrous. To be honest, I’m not even totally sure if there\n                     aren’t weirder stories out there that are actually true.<br/><br/>\n                     the end (◡‿◡✿)<br/><br/>\n</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/reddit-or-not-here-we-dumb\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on June 15th 2012, 9:00am</div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

      "html": "\n<div class=\"title\">Hiatustuck</div>\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>There\n                     will be some major pauses in updates coming up, mostly due to Flash \n                     animation chores. There will be exactly three pauses. Two of them will \n                     be related to animation. The third will not. <br/><br/> PAUSE ONE: This starts RIGHT NOW! (July 1st) I will use this time to work on the first animation. I have to travel to <a href=\"http://www.comic-con.org/cci/\" target=\"_blank\">SDCC</a> on July 11th. It’s very likely I will finish the animation before that. Once I post it, pause two will begin. <br/><br/>\n                     PAUSE TWO: I will use this time to work on another animation, to end \n                     A6A3. It will definitely be longer than pause 1, because it will include\n                     my trip to SDCC. That trip will kill an entire week of animation time. \n                     I’ll likely have to start work on it when I get back. Cross country \n                     travel is preposterously disruptive, and it’s going to slow everything \n                     down. <br/><br/> PAUSE THREE: This will begin immediately after pause two.\n                     It will not involve working on animation. I’m reserving this time to \n                     catch up on the huge amount of chores I’ve been badly neglecting, and \n                     will continue to badly neglect during pauses 1 and 2. The irony of \n                     animation pauses: you see nothing for many days, but I’m working at \n                     least twice as hard, doing nothing else. It’s a break for you, but an \n                     anti-break for me. So I need to schedule an ACTUAL break to do stuff \n                     that needs doing. Book work, plus tons of other things. I don’t know how\n                     long this pause will be yet. Probably longer than either of the first \n                     two. Let’s look at it sort of like the end of a “season”, where the \n                     season was all of act 6 so far. <br/><br/> The bottom line is, this is all\n                     going to add up to a whole lot of “me not updating Homestuck” for a \n                     while. It’s not really what I want, but there’s just no way around it. <br/><br/> I guess that’s all there is to say for now. See you after pause one! <br/><br/> Edit: wait, something else I wanted to mention. Recently some music team guys helped me update the <a href=\"/credits/soundcredits\" target=\"_blank\">sound credits page</a>,\n                     so that each entry links to the song in an album. That way, for any \n                     Flash page, it’s easy to find out exactly where that song is on <a href=\"/music\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>. For those newer to the site, I suspect this may be helpful.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/hiatustuck\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on July 1st, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

HTML5 still sucks by and large \n                        as the browser vendors bicker over standards, so I would advise you to \n                        use:\n                     </div>\n<div>-Chrome if at all possible.

It’s not officially \n                        supported, but other than the fact that ***the flash intro does not work\n                        in IE*** it seems to be working fine. (There is also a small bug where \n                        if you’re using IE, and your computer does not have an audio device, the\n                        entire app will fail to load, as sound files will not be downloaded, so\n                        plug in some headphones or even just a headphone jack attached to a \n                        wire).<br/> -Opera and Safari quite simply have not been tested.

Also \n                        update to the latest version of your browser and stop holding back HTML5\n                        you asshole!\n                     </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Best of all, it’s open source! (tentatively Apache licensed, so basically a free-for-all)</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>We’ve got a thread developing this project over here:  <a href=\"https://wheals.github.io/blogspot/mspaforums.html\">http://mspaforums.com/showthread.php?46219-Jterniabound</a> <br/>It’s\n                        dead right now, but that’s because I went into super ninja development \n                        mode for this project. I’ll be pushing the latest source to Github when I\n                        get home from work today (~5 EST). There’s been a TON of changes to the\n                        API/codebase since I went into ninja mode, we’re working to the update \n                        the wiki as quick as possible. I’m also \n                        considering developing tutorials for developing a Sburb \n                        project. But the whole thing has been designed from the ground up so \n                        that, in theory, you don’t have to touch a drop of code. The entire game\n                        is described by a bunch of modular XML files (SburbML). Of course \n                        Andrew always has some crackpot feature that exceeds the scope of the \n                        project, but usually that just means I make the API bigger and more \n                        robust. Hooray!\n                     </div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Baked in features include:</div>\n<div>Describing complex events and environments purely in XML</div>\n<div>HTML5 audio (with fall back files for supporting mp3 and ogg)</div>\n<div>Canvas and sprite-sheet based rendering </div>\n<div>Flash cutscenes (which are skipped if flash is not supported)</div>\n<div>Ability\n                        to define custom fonts (allowing the specification of local fonts, with\n                        the ability to fall back to your own personally supplied fonts)<br/> The ability to serialize almost any game state into a SburbML file, and load it back up again, for easy sharing<br/>So\n                        much dialogue producing syntax you don’t even know. Only Andrew truly \n                        grasps the magnitude of syntax, and it is something I am sure he will \n                        always regret ever requesting.\n                     </div>\n<div>Loading content on demand to minimize up front server impact and wait times<br/><br/>Note\n                        that between the XML files, dialogue syntax, and custom font support, \n                        any translators out there should have a breeze getting any translation \n                        done (except for the ultimate magnitude of the text found within)! No \n                        more decompiling SWFs for you!<br/><br/>This version will be snapshotted, \n                        but we’re gonna keep developing it. The dialogue parser/renderer (as \n                        well as the ACTUAL renderer, honestly) could likely be massively \n                        optimized, and there’s some features I want to add to the API. If you \n                        know anything about HTML5 and design, I’d love to get feedback (I’m \n                        avoiding including external libraries for the time being).\n                     </div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/im-copying-a-message-here-from-alexis-who\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on August 31st, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

(A <a href=\"/scraps2/A6I3walkthrough.gif\" target=\"_blank\">walkthrough</a> by Radiation.) <br/><br/>\n                     First, I’d originally planned to put more in the game than this, but it\n                     was running a bit long, so I decided to chop it up. I’m planning two \n                     more installments of this game, probably to be released over the next \n                     couple weeks. All the art assets and stuff is there, I just need to work\n                     with Alexis to crunch it all into a couple more new games. <br/><br/> \n                     Speaking of which, thanks to Alexis, MSPA’s tenured CODER OF GAMES, for \n                     working on this. It’s a little different. It’s the first time we’re not \n                     using Flash. Only the intro is Flash, but the game is coded in HTML5, \n                     which makes it a little more robust in some ways, but will have some \n                     issues with less common browsers. I’ve copied <a href=\"/tumblr/im-copying-a-message-here-from-alexis-who\" target=\"_blank\">a note</a>\n                     from him about it all here. Take note especially of browser info: best \n                     viewed in Chrome, Firefox is ok but not ideal, IE is very buggy and \n                     won’t show the Flash intro, and Opera/Safari aren’t tested at all. <br/><br/> Thanks to <a href=\"/credits/artcredits\" target=\"_blank\">the artists</a>\n                     (scroll to bottom) who worked on assets for this too. They’ve made a \n                     good deal more than you see here, which will appear in other \n                     installments. Thanks Stephen, Tanney, Peter, Amanda for making \n                     environment assets, and Chaz, Lexxy, Vivus, Xamag for the talking \n                     portraits. Special thanks to <a href=\"http://merrigo.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda</a>\n                     for making all the little walking sprites, as well as a whole lot of \n                     environment stuff and items.

I must\n                     first say thank you to all who backed the project, and helped us reach \n                     our goal so quickly. I’m still utterly amazed by the response. I think a\n                     lot of people checking out this project are. There still seem to be so \n                     many people out there who’ve never heard of this story, or its \n                     phenomenally dedicated following. Maybe that will start to change soon. \n                     If that turns out to be the case, again, it’s thanks to you.<br/><br/>The \n                     project may have been funded already, but there’s still plenty of time \n                     left for pledges to be made. The Kickstarter will stay open for another \n                     28 days. <strong>Every dollar raised beyond the goal will go toward improving the game.</strong>\n                     More platforms will be supported if certain stretch goals are reached. \n                     And beyond a certain point, all money will be dedicated to higher \n                     production values. $700K sounds like a lot of money, but it’s actually a\n                     very small budget for a game. Multi-platform games usually cost many \n                     millions of dollars. Increasing the budget for this is only going to \n                     make a better product.<br/><br/>This is the bottom line: because the \n                     project was funded, there WILL be a game. I’ll make sure it’s the best \n                     game the money available can possibly buy. The only question then is, \n                     how much is that? This is up to you. <strong>Over the next 28 days, the fans will decide how great they want this game to be!</strong><br/><br/>So,\n                     here are the stretch goals we’re starting with, which represent both \n                     enhancements to the game the extra money gets us, as well as extra \n                     reward perks certain milestones unlock. As I type this, we’re already \n                     getting pretty close to Mac support. Soon we’ll add a better graphic of \n                     all the goals to the Kickstarter page.<br/><br/>$700,000.00    FUNDED!<br/>$800,000.00    Mac Support<br/>$850,000.00    New reward tier perk unlocked<br/>$900,000.00    Linux Support<br/>$950,000.00    ???<br/>$1,000,000.00   ???<br/>$1,100,000.00   ???<br/>$1,250,000.00   ???<br/>(??? revealed later. More stretch goals to be added if necessary.)<br/><br/>Also,\n                     later in the Kickstarter we’ll begin revealing some hidden reward \n                     tiers. I notice the Snoutpaks sold out pretty fast. We should be \n                     revealing new reward bundles later on that contain more scalemate \n                     plushes. Keep an eye out for them. <strong>Also remember that at any \n                     time you can increase your pledge if you ever feel like claiming a \n                     higher reward tier. Just remember to select the reward tier you want \n                     when adjusting your dollar amount pledged.</strong><br/><br/>If you backed\n                     the project, thanks again for the support. And if you haven’t yet, I \n                     hope you’ll consider it, and help us make this the best game it can be!\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/you-find-a-fatherly-note-taped-to-your-tumblr-dash-it\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on September 6th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

      "html": "\n<div class=\"title\">A non-Kickstarter update.</div>\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>My plan was to post the <a href=\"/mspa/007163\" target=\"_blank\">A6I3 mini-game</a>\n                     in three parts consecutively. I’m still going to post all three parts, \n                     but I’ve decided to break them up with some regular updates between each\n                     instead.<br/><br/>Between setting up and launching the Kickstarter, and \n                     then keeping up with the crazy whirlwind it’s become, I’ve had \n                     absolutely no time to work on the second mini-game yet. So rather than \n                     just keep delaying the update, I’ll post a reasonably regular stream of \n                     updates while I work on it. I’ll probably do the same thing between \n                     parts 2 and 3. <br/><br/>To some extent I’m doing it this way because I’m \n                     getting a little tired of MSPA being in “infinite hiatus mode\" which has\n                     characterized most of the summer. There have been a lot of long waits, \n                     due to traveling, big animation projects, working on the mini-game, and \n                     of course planning the Kickstarter. For the entire month of August, my \n                     time was split pretty evenly between working on the A6I3 update, and \n                     planning the Kickstarter. There was a massive amount of unseen work that\n                     went into that, not just to plan the Kickstarter itself, getting the \n                     rewards ready and all that, but to make sure we had a solid development \n                     plan in place down the road if it got funded.<br/><br/>This has really \n                     seemed like one of the busiest summers for me ever, but unfortunately \n                     all that labor isn’t reflected too well by the archive spanning those \n                     dates. I’m more than ready to get back to business as usual* for MSPA.<br/><br/>*note it still won’t be QUITE up to usual speed, because I’ll still be working on part 2 of the mini-game behind the scenes.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/a-non-kickstarter-update\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on September 7th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

We’ll also reveal \n                     something higher up on the ladder.\n                  </p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-1.jpg\"><img height=\"481\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-1.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-2.jpg\"><img height=\"481\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-2.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-3.jpg\"><img src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/tarot-photo-3.jpg\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-tote.jpg\"><img height=\"507\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-tote.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-shirts.jpg\"><img height=\"447\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-shirts.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-pins.jpg\"><img height=\"224\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-pins.jpg\" width=\"640\"/></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"noIcon\" href=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-stickers.jpg\"><img height=\"348\" src=\"/archive/social/tumblr/seer-stickers.jpg\" width=\"620\"/></a></p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/seerpak\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on September 17th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

The response to it continues to be fantastic, and my gratitude to the backers is equally continuous. <br/><br/> Thanks to everyone who beta tested the <a href=\"/mspa/007208\" target=\"_blank\">recent update</a>\n                     in advance of its release. Anyone who pledged $50 or more was sent an \n                     early beta version and a feedback form to help us sort out the bugs. The\n                     same offer will apply for the next and final minigame installment. If \n                     you have pledged $50 or more by the end of the Kickstarter, you’ll get \n                     an advance copy to test sent through the Kickstarter message system. If \n                     you pledge, just be sure you select a reward tier at $55 or more, so \n                     that we know to send you a copy. (Note this is unrelated to the $1.5MM \n                     stretch goal, which states that ALL BACKERS will be allowed to beta test\n                     the adventure game itself, before it is released in 2014.) <br/><br/> \n                     Also, once the Kickstarter is over, we’re going to put up a Paypal \n                     pledging option for the project. A lot of people seem to only be able to\n                     use Paypal to pledge, which Kickstarter doesn’t allow. So for a brief \n                     window after, one or two weeks, you’ll be able to pledge via Paypal for \n                     the same reward tiers at the same prices. The window will be fairly \n                     short so that we can compile all the orders and ship the rewards out in a\n                     timely fashion. We’re expecting a good number of people may want things\n                     to ship in time for the holiday season. If you’re in the U.S. or \n                     Canada, it’s very likely this will be the case. <br/><br/> For those who \n                     haven’t pledged yet, this might be something to consider. The timing of \n                     the shipping here means that buying rewards could actually double as \n                     holiday shopping. If you see yourself doing holiday shopping for people a\n                     couple months down the road anyway, this might be a good advance \n                     opportunity. A lot of those pricier bundles start to pile up so much \n                     extra cool stuff, seems to me this makes for a good chance to divvy them\n                     up as holiday gifts for friends, maybe some of whom didn’t have enough \n                     money for the bigger bundles. <br/><br/> Whatever the final total winds up\n                     being, you have already helped make this Kickstarter an overwhelming \n                     success.

I’ll try to get whatever work done I can around \n                     this crazy mission. An 11K heap of large prints is actually so much \n                     paper, we’re not sure if we can keep it all in the same room, because it\n                     might actually cause the floor to collapse. True safety facts. <br/><br/>\n</p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/the-site-was-down-for-a-few-days-there-but-we-are\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on November 4th, 2012                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

      "html": "\n<div class=\"copy\">\n<p>\n<!-- more -->\n</p>\n<p>So I just dialed down the joke on page 7623.</p>\n<p><br/>The thing with that joke was:<br/><br/>Poking\n                     a little fun at an ongoing point of controversy surrounding the comic, \n                     without trying to make a statement on anyone’s position in particular.<br/><br/>The thing with that joke was not:<br/><br/>Admonishing\n                     those who wish to maintain non-white headcanons for characters. Or \n                     those disappointed to see Trickster Jane with skintone. Or anyone \n                     really. There was not any coherent ‘TAKE THAT’ going on here.<br/><br/>At \n                     least that was not the intent. I can see how it would appear that is \n                     what I wished to communicate, but it is not. If that is an \n                     interpretation that will commonly persist I’d rather just ditch the \n                     joke. Or at least tone it way down, which I did.<br/><br/>But actually \n                     what motivates me more to revise it is noticing more than a few unsavory\n                     individuals using it as justification to harass POCs or anyone who, \n                     reasonably, wanted to voice their concerns. On reflection I’d rather not\n                     have my decisions serve as fodder for the arguments of such people. \n                     They don’t speak for me.<br/><br/>As a humorist, and someone who writes a \n                     provocative and unpredictable story, there are many types of unpleasant \n                     responses to my stuff I can easily accept. But some types… maybe not so \n                     much.<br/><br/>The original joke from my perspective really was a \n                     lighthearted jab at the storied subject of race in the comic, and the \n                     debates about it over the years. Mainly I thought the gag was tempered \n                     by its utterly absurd presentation, and made so over the top as to \n                     compromise its ability to be taken seriously. Beyond the pale of usual \n                     absurdity even for Homestuck, as has been the case with all this \n                     trickster stuff. Trickster mode, you’ve probably observed, is a sort of \n                     ridiculous game powerup, like a Mario star or Kirby’s lollipop, which \n                     for a while brings everything to a frantic and surreal place. In this \n                     case those effects apply to Homestuck in its entirety, the characters, \n                     visuals, flow of story, the site itself, and the sense of humor, all \n                     getting a little warped and pushed a bit outside the usual comfort \n                     zones. <br/><br/>Tricksters were once an easter egg in HS a long time ago,\n                     and they kept picking up steam in the fandom. So, as is often the case \n                     with MSPA, the idea has been adapted as a nod to the readership, in a \n                     way that is compatible with the story’s logic. Fans have always drawn \n                     them as particularly cherubic white kids, and so that’s how they look in\n                     the comic. But this creates a really strange disparity between their \n                     skintone and the usual blank #ffffff depiction of human characters. This\n                     alone makes them a pretty bizarre addition to the story and contributes\n                     toward pushing this arc into sort of a narrative uncanny valley. I was \n                     inclined to address this flagrant coloration disparity by making a \n                     totally ridiculous, way over the top joke about it. That’s because jokes\n                     are pretty much all I do. I even turn my jokes into jokes. (See the \n                     edited page.)<br/><br/>Personally I still think the original gag is pretty\n                     funny. But I had the benefit of knowing exactly where I was coming \n                     from. I think the new joke is pretty funny too. Maybe even more funny, \n                     if you have the benefit of remembering the old one. <br/><br/>I know I \n                     have a reputation for riling people up, so some probably think this was \n                     my chief motivation. But not really. My primary goal is always to do \n                     what I think is funny. I’m not saying I wasn’t expecting some kind of \n                     controversy from invoking the subject, but neither did I anticipate the \n                     particular texture of the response, which isn’t sitting well with me. So\n                     in retrospect, I decided THIS time, the gag wasn’t really worth it. \n                     Especially if it just galvanizes an army of tools against people who \n                     have to deal with shit like that too often already. So to those people, I\n                     will apologize.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/more-so-i-just-dialed-down-the-joke-on-page\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on January 13th 2013, 5:00pm                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"

You guys made ANDREW HUSSIE take the Caucasian joke completely out\n                        of his comic. *slow claps* That… I don’t even know what to say. You \n                        made one of the only people who could say and do whatever they damn well\n                        please change, completely missing the point of trolling, sarcasm, \n                        irony, etc. Happy now? Isn’t censorship so much fun? Welcome to the real\n                        world, do you think it gets any better? Or are you just happy when \n                        you’re on the other side of the joke?\n                     </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Am I the only one who wasn’t a butthurt socialjusticefag about hussie’s headcannon joke and actually lolled rather than pouting</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I\n                        will simply say that this is what can happen when a webcomic gets huge \n                        like Homestuck does.  You simply draw your imaginary webcomic \n                        character as a different color, and every hypersensitive freak has a \n                        meltdown over it. This is why social justice is an inherent constraining\n                        force on all art.  Social justice is in essence a form of \n                        censorship, which is antithetical to art.\n                     </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Manning the \n                        fuck up? He did nothing wrong. He didn’t do it to start a fight, he even\n                        said so himself. It’s you, the idiot bitch who gets upset when white \n                        people are in existence (which is racism by the way) that caused him to \n                        change it. If you don’t like that, maybe you should commit suicide!\n                     </li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few, picked out semi-randomly, ranging from “mild, but missing the point” to “unspeakably terrible”.<br/><br/>Ironically, attitudes like this were much more responsible for my decision to change the joke than any form of “SJW crusading”.<br/><br/>In\n                     fact I didn’t even really see all that much reactionary SJ boilerplate \n                     in response to it. I did notice a lot of people expressing some \n                     reasonable opinions about it, and being met with an excessive amount of \n                     rhetoric like this.<br/><br/>Again, I can’t say I wasn’t expecting a mixed\n                     reaction to the joke. But stuff like this, in such high volume, is well\n                     beyond the result I wanted. It’s fine if you found the original joke \n                     funny, but if you defend it to others in this way you aren’t speaking \n                     for me. Your straw man arguments are not my own, and by making the joke I\n                     was not authorizing you to harass others. By changing the joke I’m just\n                     taking responsibility for not thinking these outcomes all the way \n                     through.<br/><br/>I’ve said I thought the joke was funny. But if some feel\n                     differently, and I see them being widely attacked for it; that doesn’t \n                     mean I won’t empathize with them because I’m so convinced “THEY JUST \n                     DON’T GET IT!” And seeing too many people with that exact attitude was \n                     what first got me thinking “yeah, I gotta change this.”<br/><br/>This is \n                     why the claim “social justice is in essence a form of censorship” is so \n                     ironic here. Because the forces of social justice aren’t actually making\n                     me change anything. In this case, it’s actually the people who OPPOSE \n                     those concerns in the ugliest manner who motivated me to “censor” \n                     myself.<br/><br/>Most people here would agree that some SJ enthusiasts can\n                     get pretty carried away. But if you feel convinced social justice is a \n                     crushing form of censorship, you might want to rethink that idea. \n                     Because apparently “one of the only people who could say and do whatever\n                     they damn well pleased” for the first time ever decided to redact a \n                     joke, not because of SJ bloggers, but because of the behavior of their \n                     most strident critics. And if you truly dislike censorship, and do not \n                     wish to see more self-censorship in the future, then you would be doing \n                     your part to behave in a way that doesn’t make creators feel embarrassed\n                     to be defended by you.\n                  </p>\n</div>\n<a href=\"/tumblr/lets-take-a-look-at-a-few-responses-more\">\n<div class=\"footer for_permalink\">\n<div class=\"date\">Posted on January 13th 2013, 9:43pm                                                                    </div>\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n</a>\n<div class=\"footer\" style=\"                        display:none;                                                                    \">\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n"
