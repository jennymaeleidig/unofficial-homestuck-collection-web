        "body": "<div class=\"media-body\">\n<p>\n</p><p>A brand new webcomic, to be exact. One that has launched on the 5th anniversary of Homestuck's first page. If the thirteenth of April holds a magical place in your heart, then chances are, you are on pins and needles waiting for me to post the end of the story. It will still be quite some time before that happens. I've had too much else going on to be able to attack the remaining content with the ferocity that has been characteristic of my update schedule over the years. It is nothing short of The Greatest Tragedy that a beloved story is held hostage to the ability of a single artist to continue creating it. Which brings us to the website called Paradox Space, and the chapter it will represent in Homestuck's extended life cycle.</p>\n<p>As I work on finishing the story, I tend to think a lot about where Homestuck as a creative property goes from here. It's hard to ignore the fact that it has turned into something much bigger than just a long, crazy story on the internet. It has a lot of fans, and there's a whole culture surrounding it. Friendships have been made, lives have been changed, or so people tell me. Those who like HS are extremely fond of the characters, yet those characters are trapped - \"stuck\" if you will - inside a very particular narrative, which itself has been at the mercy of my ability to produce it. So when I think about the future of Homestuck, I envision projects which liberate the things people love about it from the story itself, and most importantly, from my intensive personal effort.</p>\n<p>So this website is the first major step in that direction. Here is the idea:</p>\n<p>Paradox Space will feature many short comic stories involving literally any characters and settings from Homestuck. Any point in canon could be visited and elaborated on, whether it's backstory, some scenes that were skipped over or alluded to, funny hypothetical scenarios which have nothing to do with canon events, or exploring things that could have happened in canon through the \"doomed timeline\" mechanic that is a defining trait of Homestuck's multiverse-continuum known as \"paradox space\". There is a WHOLE LOT of fun stuff we can do here; and we will!</p>\n<p>The idea is also to get a lot of different artists and writers involved. It's going to be a major team effort. Occasionally I will write some comic scripts, particularly at the onset to help get this off the ground. But I'd like that to be the exception rather than the rule. I think it will be exciting to see how a talented pool of creators can work within the HS universe, and what they will bring to these characters. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see who's contributing so far. I guarantee that list of names will expand considerably in the months ahead.</p>\n<p>And a quick shout-out to those I regard as the core contributors of Paradox Space. Rachel and Kory, who are the managing editors of the content. Tauhid, who designed this sick website. And Matt, who coded this sick website. These people worked very hard to get this site up and running. They did a great job.</p>\n<p>Paradox Space updates with a new page every weekday, starting this week. Next update is Tuesday, with the first page of another short story. What's it gonna be?? Believe me when I say these arcs can involve anything and anyone.</p>\n<p>The first story was drawn by Zack Morrison, who is a super solid comic maker. You should take a look at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140413205013/http://www.paranatural.net/\" target=\"_blank\">his webcomic</a> when you get the chance. It's really good! I'm not even \"just sayin\" that either. Why do ya think we asked him to make the first comic?? Dude's great. ;-]</p>\n</div>",

Frankly, shame on you if you were.</p>\n<p>\"Headed for Stardom\" is by Jonathan Griffiths. Observe more of his fine work <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://www.beyondthecanopy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">over here</a>!</p>\n<p>Soon I will take a step back from this news section and let other voices emerge. I'm the stern guardian figure pushing several frightened children on a rickety little bike, and they're all nervous as hell. But I'm not. I'm smiling and beaming with pride as I let go of the bike at the top of a steep hill, which has a ramp at the bottom that launches over Sadcorpse Canyon. They're not sure if they can make it. But I know they can. I know they can. (Also, they're chained to the bike.)</p>\n<p>Now for a few \"frequently asked questions\", or as I like to call them, FREQAQUES.</p>\n<p><u>Do you have an RSS feed?</u></p>\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://www.paradoxspace.com/rss.atom\" target=\"_blank\">here it is</a>. </p>\n<p><u>Are these comics canon?</u></p>\n<p>I think you will have to use your own judgment on that. Sometimes there's going to be some truly ridiculous nonsense that could not have possibly happened in canon. Other times, the events portrayed will at least be plausible, and will present no contradiction. Does that then mean those events are canon? Hard to say. A formal ruling here does not seem appropriate. </p>\n<p>If you want me to give you some guidelines that are AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE, here you go. For any given story, it is either \"Definitely Not Canon\" or \"Possibly Canon\". But no story should ever be regarded as \"Definitely Canon\", unless Homestuck itself confirms those events retroactively in some manner. Does that make sense??</p>\n<p><u>I really want to know about X, but Paradox Space keeps running a lot of silly shit that isn't answering my questions about Homestuck.</u></p>\n<p>This isn't frequently asked yet (also, it isn't a question), but I'm anticipating the sentiment. Primarily, PS content will involve a lot of silly, funny stories that feature fun characters saying stupid things to each other and doing funny, silly things together. Much like Homestuck itself! SOMETIMES, these stories may brush with topics or events that weren't fully elaborated on in Homestuck, and may offer some intriguing insight into what might have happened during certain unembellished portions of canon. But such stories are not guaranteed to be the site's principle offering. Viewing it as an effort to pad out HS by filling all the holes and answering all the mysteries is not the right way to look at it. The right way to look at it is to see PS as a funny source of entertainment, where funny and entertaining comics are posted every weekday. And sometimes, those comics will be \"interesting\" as well.</p>\n</div>",

Have you caught up on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://paranatural.net/\">Paranatural</a> yet? </p>\n<p>It seems I have a few small issues to address! It is raining here and therefore the title to this post is appropriate and funny (you are not required to laugh). </p>\n<p>Some people have expressed severe negative reactions to Karkat's having a pink tongue in this comic. For reference, I've come up with a series of exploratory questions one can ask oneself to figure out whether an issue in a comic is one that's worth fretting over.</p>\n<p><strong>Is this something that is important to canon?</strong></p>\n<p>Karkat's blood color would be an important thing, and would be a big mistake if we got it wrong! Karkat's tongue color, on the other hand, has not been mentioned in canon. We can assume that unless tongue color turns out to be an extremely important part of beating Lord English, it is probably not important at all. </p>\n<p><strong>Is this important to the story being told?</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes things that aren't important to canon can be important to the small stories that we tell. But since Karkat's tongue hasn't been important (yet?!) in this story, it's probably not important at all.</p>\n<p>I don't want to make light of small quibbles! (Okay, I do, but not too much.) I understand that canon adherence is really important to some people. But that's not what we're really about here. If you're looking for information, the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Homestuck\">Homestuck wiki</a> is remarkably well-kept by its very dedicated caretakers. (In fact, so well-kept that we often use it to check our stories and refresh our memories.) But Paradox Space is going to generally be much more about telling stories than it is about canonicity. </p>\n<p>I'm also aware that there's been some dismay that no stories yet have reached the full depth of emotion that Homestuck itself has. To this I'm sort of forced to say, Well, duh. So far we've been telling short, lighthearted stories. Homestuck has literally thousands of pages to move smoothly (or sometimes not that smoothly) between emotional gears; our longest story so far is this seven-page one that's running! We do have some more serious stories in the works, and we do want to reach more emotional range, but the only way we can even try for that is because we're working with established characters in an established universe. What it boils down to, I guess, is please have patience and trust us!</p>\n<p>Another thing I've heard pretty repetitively has been <strong>Oooh! I know where this story is going!</strong> And again I find myself forced to say--Well, duh. Predicting where a story is going when it's told at this pace isn't truly that hard. I hope that what you enjoy is the telling of it, rather than just the prediction of where it's going. As always, serial readers find themselves in a very different position than archival readers. </p>\n<p>Two more things to address: One, we're still getting lots of people writing in and asking how they can work with us. <strong>Right now, you can't. If we're interested in working together, we will come to you.</strong> I know that it's taught, especially in art schools, that there's no harm in being confident and putting yourself out there--but for us, right now, it's truly more annoying than it is helpful. If we're looking for artists, we'll let you know, I promise! </p>\n<p>Two, dear, sweet, precious, sweet, sweet, readers. If you're asking <strong>Why aren't we talking about this?!</strong> or <strong>Has anyone else seen this?!</strong> I can assure you on both counts that people have seen it and are talking about it. In every single instance I have seen of those questions, it is so. Perhaps, dear readers, you need to look around a little better. </p>\n<p>If you have any other small questions, in addition to our email, you can shoot them to me on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://rachelpxs.tumblr.com/\">my tumblr made specifically for that purpose</a> if it delights you to do so. </p>\n<p>Oh--and for goodness' sake, stop asking about <a href=\"/pxs/headed-for-stardom/2\">that rabbit.</a></p>\n</div>",

My name is Matt Hink- as the fourth member of the Paradox Space team, I am the resident web developer and in fact, all-round technical guy for the site.  A significant portion of my job is taking the (often somewhat unhinged) ideas that the rest of the team has and turn them into a functioning website.  As some of you may have noticed, this is generally easier said than done.

But you can rest assured that I am constantly behind the scenes keeping a wary and at times paranoid eye over the Paradox Space server(s).</p>\n<p>And now, a few fun facts.</p>\n<p>DID YOU KNOW?  During launch, our rate of requests peaked at around 3500 requests per minute, meaning that <strong>every second</strong>, about 58 users were accessing the site.  Happily, the wave of the Homestuck fandom didn't even come close to knocking us over.  Since then, we're down to about 200-300 requests per minute over the course of the day.</p>\n<p>DID YOU KNOW?  The 404 (File Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) images were drawn by KC Green and Shad Andrews, respectively.</p>\n<p>DID YOU KNOW?  The final pre-launch touches to Paradox Space were made 4 minutes and 13 seconds before 4:13 on 04/13?</p>\n<p>Well, now you do.</p>\n<p>Couple notes of recognition: thanks to everyone who's emailed in bug reports to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140430154248/mailto:issues@paradoxspace.com\">issues@paradoxspace.com</a>- I do read them and generally take them into account.

The fact that it's me is how you know something weird is going on.</p>\n<p>Here's a cool thing that will happen with this website sometimes. Every now and then, we will flip a switch, and that little button that says \"2x UPDATE COMBO WEEK\" will appear up there in the corner. This means for that week, Paradox Space will update with two pages per day. </p>\n<p>I know, right? That's a lot of comics! When the idea for this site was first conceived, this is something I pictured as a standard for it. Frequently more than one (or even more than two??) pages per day. I would like to work toward this being a more common thing for the site. For now though, it will be kind of a special thing. It will take some time to make that idea sustainable. Posting ten pages in a week burns through a lot of comics! But as this comic-making process gets more streamlined, it is my hope that this will occur more often - perhaps it will even become normal.</p>\n<p>Part of \"making it sustainable\" has to do with cost. In case it was not obvious, I'm paying all the writers and artists a decent page-rate to make everything you see here. In fact, this is probably one of the most expensive webcomics to run for that reason. Usually, a webcomic involves one guy like me, who just makes a bunch of stuff \"for free\", puts it up, and whatever the site makes covers server costs, and some extra for the webcomic guy to live on. This is a much more distributed production though, involving many people. And that's fine! At one page per day we can make that work without a sweat. It's when you start racking up multiple pages per day, the costs start getting kooky. So my intention is to work on figuring that out, to make it sustainable. By optimizing ads, printing books, etc. Your support, as always, is critical and appreciated.</p>\n<p>What is implied here is that I am thinking in the long term with this site, and expecting it to grow and evolve. Part of that is frequency of the content. The other part is nature of the content. I spoke of what kind of comics to expect here in my initial spiel, but I think I can simplify it further.</p>\n<p>It seems to me there will be two types of content this site runs. The funny and gaggy kind, like the one my pal <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140515222130/http://www.gunshowcomic.com/\">\nKC Green</a> did a couple weeks ago, and the one running currently by the very funny <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140515222130/http://www.gastrophobia.com/\">\nDaisy McGuire</a>. These are comics full of laffs, but quite obviously have no relation to canon events. Then there is the more \"substantive\" kind, which conceivably could have taken place in canon, and contribute a little more to your understanding of the characters and the story overall. The Flarp story last week by Benito and Kristin I think fits this description. Sure seems like that arc could have happened in canon, doesn't it? If that is what you would like to believe, you will get no argument from me. Eridan getting owned is ALWAYS plausible, the end.</p>\n<p>My sense is that as this comic goes along, the latter type of content will be more exciting to the audience. Chuckles are always great, but \"substantive\" elaboration on the characters and universe are understandably seen as more rewarding. So I will try to nudge production in that direction. Again, it'll take some time to make that a fully sustainable idea. I can't just snap my fingers and expect other writers to have the comprehensive understanding of all this nonsense that I have. It'll take a while to get there. But I am patient. I am also confident that the creative people behind this operation will keep putting out good comics, and that this site will continue evolving into something you will find more rewarding to visit with each passing month.</p>\n<p>Now let's all kick back, relax, and google some horse memes.</p>\n<p>Edit: Whoaaa. Those are all HORRIBLE. Let's forget I suggested that idea!</p>\n</div>",

These things have colors and words on them.  This may confuse and alarm you, but these things have a name.</p>\n<p>They are called TAGS.</p>\n<p>After talking it over in our weekly video calls (during which I usually just nod sagely while Kory, Rachel, and Tauhid discuss the finer details of comic scheduling and do Actual Work), we decided that what Paradox Space REALLY NEEDS is another way for us to insert EVEN MORE hilarious sideline commentary in a website that's already packed to the brim with cool stuff.</p>\n<p>You'll notice that there are several types of tags which appear at the bottom of each page.  The colorful tags describe two things: the creator(s) of the comic, and the characters appearing in the comic.  (The Critical Wh8le was granted charactership in a landslide victory for curmudgeonly sea mammals worldwide.)</p>\n<p>The not-colorful tags (I've heard they're called 'desaturated', but I don't approve of that sort of language) are simply other ways for us to make silly and pointless remarks about comics.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, hiding down below the \"Recent Stories\" panel is a friendly button which says TAG CLOUD.  Clicking this will make allllllll of the tags (all of them) in the entire comic appear for your perusal.</p>\n<p>Thanks to everyone who's gotten in touch via issues@paradoxspace.com and questions@paradoxspace.com!</p>\n<p>P.S.

You saw <a href=\"/pxs/a-fun-day-for-gcat\">A Fun Day For GCAT</a> that was written by me and beautifully drawn by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.eiffelart.ca/\">Matt Cummings</a>. Then you saw the exciting, mostly-grey adventure of <a href=\"/pxs/quality-time\">Quality Time</a>, which was drawn by the incredible <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://hannibrosh.com/\">Hanni Brosh</a> and written by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://mspaintadventures.com/\">an obscure writer you probably haven't heard of</a>. </p>\n<p>And now here we are, together, with <a href=\"/pxs/fetch-quest\">Fetch Quest</a>, written by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://poinko.tumblr.com/\">Phil Gibson</a> and drawn by <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/\">Evan Dahm</a>. Evan's story <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/see/\">Rice Boy</a> was one of the earliest webcomics I got into, and it's really beautiful, as are his other works. I have to admit that I am not current with <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/vattu/\">Vattu</a>--ever since <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/order/\">Order of Tales</a> my preference has been to wait and buy the books when they come out. Curling up with a brand new Evan Dahm hardcover knowing it's all new to you is an experience to be cherished. But don't let that stop you reading those stories! I have it on good authority that my waiting around makes me A Weirdo.</p>\n<p>One not-totally-intentional side effect to Paradox Space is that we're exposing a lot of people to artists and writers they might not have known otherwise. We really try to work with people whose work we love and admire, which of course leads to us approaching artists whose work we've followed. We do want to bring totally new artists to you, too; but it's my hope that you'll follow at least one of those author or artist links and find a new love. Homestuck is great, but there's so much more out there too!</p>\n<h5>Haha just kidding it's all Homestuck don't look around <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/home.php\">read our comics buy our toys</a></h5>\n</div>",

That's right, it's a Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff Meowrail Sandwich!</p>\n<p>They're a little more unusual than your garden variety tuna salad so let me explain. You take two thin slices of SBAHJ bread--not too much or it will become overwhelming--and between them you put a nice sturdy helping of meowrails. Two great tastes that taste great together, and need a whole week to be fully enjoyed!</p>\n<p>So what I'm saying is we have one page of SBAHJ to start you off, by the illustrious and hilarious <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://kcgreendotcom.com/\">KC Green</a>. KC is a super cool guy and one of the few who really have the chops to make something SBAHJ without being over the top. Plus, he just started a cool <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://backcomic.com/\">comic called \"Back\"</a> that he's making with <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://nedroid.com/\">Anthony Clark</a>! You should check it out. </p>\n<p>In the middle of the week--right now--we have <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://poinko.tumblr.com/\">Phil Gibson</a>'s second story, \"Hunting Lesson,\" this one illustrated by the extremely skilled <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://paperseverywhere.tumblr.com/\">Adrienne Garcia</a>, who you may know by the name \"paperseverywhere.\" She came to our attention with her gorgeous fan art and we were extremely pleased that she had the time and desire to work with us!</p>\n<p>And to round out the week we'll have one more slice of SBAHJ--but I'll leave that mysterious for now. </p>\n<p>I'm extremely pleased on a personal level that we finally have a story where Equius gets to shine. He is my pride and joy, inasmuch as a sweaty, fictional alien teen can be such a thing. For a while I was trying to think of something special I could do whenever we had an Equius comic, but I ultimately decided that I would have to be content with just feeling smug. (Which I do.)</p>\n<p>Finally, a small note. PXS is currently looking for <strong>professional freelance inkers</strong>. We have avoided opening submissions in any way because we're more than sure that it would be opening a floodgate we don't have the time or energy to deal with. However, in this case, we are counting on you, our perspicacious audience, to self-select wisely. If you are an experienced artist whose inking skills are as exemplary as your professionalism, please <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/mailto:rachel@whatpumpkin.com\">shoot me an email</a>. In this email, please include a link to your portfolio (not attached files), a little about yourself and your level of experience, and any other information that might be germane to working with you. If you know someone who fulfills these requirements we would vastly prefer that rather than writing in to us with their info, you ask them to email us themselves. </p>\n<p>Thanks everyone, hope you enjoy your sandwich! There's also some potato chips to go with it, and a nice apple, because fruits and veggies are important.</p>\n</div>",

Here we are.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that this comic is in black and white! That's because DAMARA is an homage to the work of Junji Ito, particularly \"TOMIE\". If you like spooky manga, check it out! (You can read DAMARA without reading TOMIE first, but it may make more sense if you do.) (A note: TOMIE has some mature content, particularly gore.)</p>\n<p>In less-specific news: new contributors!! It's been a while since our last news post (not a lot to report, sorry!) but you should be sure to check out the contributor panel for info and links on our new artists!! DAMARA is inked by the fantastic Tom Siddell (go read <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141024091325/http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/\">Gunnerkrigg Court</a> right now. It's okay, I'll wait here until you finish) and I also want to give shout-outs to Incineraptor and Mary Cagle!!\nOh, and there's me I guess. Hi! My name is Blueberry and I'm an Assistant Editor here at Paradox Space. I also have a really cute cat.</p>\n<p>I think that's everything for now. Thanks for reading!!</p>\n</div>",

This comic was laid out and sketched by the incredibly skilled <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://deadwinter.cc/\">Allison Shabet</a>, who will probably be talking a bit about the process at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://rallyyy.tumblr.com/\">her blog</a> (or <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://www.patreon.com/deadwinter\">her Patreon</a>?) sometime over the next few weeks.

You can back <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://www.patreon.com/helvetica\">Jones on Patreon</a>, too.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, I guess <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/\">some guy wrote it</a>, too.

Keep an eye out here and on MSPA for news as it occurs.

In the meantime, we'd like to thank each and every one of you who've supported us during this past year. It's been a new experience for all of us, and we're so grateful you came along with us on this weird little journey!</p>\n<p>From myself personally, I'd like to extend an extra thanks to everyone we've worked with--especially my coworkers, the other editors of PXS, who are hardworking, tireless, and lovely. I'd also like to thank all the visual artists, writers, designers, and other freelancers we've worked with, who have sweat blood for what are objectively very silly stories, and to whom I could not be more grateful or appreciative. Working with, as they say, \"creatives\" is my favorite part of the job and I feel very humbled and lucky to have worked with you all!</p>\n<p>Happy 413, everyone. :)</p>\n</div>",
