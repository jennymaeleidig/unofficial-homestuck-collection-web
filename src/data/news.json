The rest are new, never before heard, and all of them (including the first two I mentioned) were made specifically for this album. <br/><br/>I had this idea to start making \"fake bands\" based on various characters from MSPA some time ago, back when the music project was starting up and I soon realized I'd have way more music on my hands than I could possibly use in the story. MC was the first such band, which guys in the music community started working on stuff for last summer. The whole thing got sidetracked for a while, but we decided to finish it over the course of the intermission for obvious reasons. It turned into a 19 song monster album, and I think all the songs came out fantastic, and really match the group's motif quite well.<br/><br/>The idea behind the fake bands was to put a spin on a certain genre, in a way that seemed in keeping with the characters and what sort of music they'd make. In MC's case the genre is something we've been referring to as \"dark jazz\". <br/><br/>I'd like to keep putting out more albums by more bands, with more interesting spins on musical styles to help develop characters and their universe. There certainly seems to be enough talent to keep it coming. I really wouldn't mind flooding you guys with awesome original music, even if I can't manage to work most of it into animated pages. Which obviously I can't. But projects like these albums are the next best thing.<br/><br/>In addition to some familiar names like Hadley and Bowman, there are a lot of great new artists represented in this album, who haven't yet authored something appearing in HS. But the newer folks made some of my favorite stuff there. I recommend you give the whole thing a thorough listen. Thanks to everyone for working on this, and as always, thanks to Cindy for configuring all the tedious Bandcamp stuff.<br/><br/>And just to remind you, the artists make most of the money you pay for it. At $5.25 for 19 songs, we're talking a pretty serious bargain.<br/><br/>A final note: when I said it was unforshadowed, I guess that <a href=\"/mspa/002253\" target=\"_self\">wasn't entirely true</a>.  <br/><br/>P.S. Homestuck Volume 4 album isn't far off either. Just need to collect a few more songs for it first.\n"

I wouldn't even think to try to pull off something like the Act 4 page without his computer codes. Basically I say to him something I want the thing to do, and then the next day that is what the thing does. I'm not really sure how he does it. Sometimes though I hear that phrase directed at me and my work, and I just laugh it off as an expression grounded in the utterly ridiculous. So I'll laugh it off for him on his behalf. He he he he he.<br/><br/>(<a href=\"http://www.timelesschaos.com/teambffcomics/\" target=\"_blank\">Here is some sort of funny comic</a> that he is, at least tangentially, involved with. Though primarily authored by his pal and mine, Mr. Rinehart-Taylor.)<br/><br/>Also this update marks the first time a page in MSPA has featured art not drawn by me, or not plundered hamfistedly through google's vast image agglomeratrix. <a href=\"http://mcmittens.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cindy</a> drew some nice assets for this, and for this I thank her. (Yeah she never updates her site. Believe me, I share your frown.) Maybe I will consider more distributed art projects in the future. I may have to, if I want to finish this goddamn thing some time this epoch.<br/><br/>Another note: if the \"game\" performance is slow (not to load, but to play) then it is not the internet's fault, but your computer's fault. Which is to say it's actually my fault for putting too much crap in the gigantic room. I will possibly look into optimizing this further, and will <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">certainly</span> not repeat the mistake in future pages. I remind you that there isn't really a \"dev team\" or a \"testing group\" or \"quality control\" as would be present for most commercial software enterprises.

I'm not all that partial to the compulsory global prank-off.<br/><br/><img alt=\"Clown\" src=\"/archive/social/news/icon_clown.gif\"/> <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">OR AM I?</span> <img alt=\"Clown\" src=\"/archive/social/news/icon_clown.gif\"/><br/><br/>The answer to this question is no. <br/><br/>But sometimes I play April Fool's pranks on accident. Remember last April when I <a href=\"/mspa/5\" target=\"_self\">started Homestuck in Flash</a>, then decided not to and just called all those pages the HS beta? That was sort of like a retroactive 4/1 prank. The joke is there was no joke, which in a world made of jokes, can be the best joke of all.<br/><br/>So is there anything pseudoprankish about this year's 4/1 <a href=\"/mspa/003541\" target=\"_self\">offering</a>? I can see why the jape-jaundiced eye may regard it with caution, if not actual disdain. (You see why this holiday is nothing but trouble?? It befouls the lighthearted with the curmudgeonly taint of skepticism!) All I can say is, give it a day or two. 4/2 should be anointed a special day in its own right. A day for those drunk on gullibility to nurse their hangovers. Like the day after St. Patrick's, but instead of green beer you drank lots of lame bogus press releases.<br/><br/>I've been really busy lately. That I've been able to squeeze out a few simple pages here and there has been a little beaded string of glittering miracles. I finally had some time to grind out a really cool animation though with a guy doing flips and stuff, so I thought that was pretty sweet.<br/><br/>Jan found some time to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PZ5fLeLujI\" target=\"_blank\">do some editing</a> too, which is always promising. We'll kick out some more of these soon I hope. He will edit. I will shout funny ideas at him, and wave around this stick I found. I will not edit though. No, because:<br/><br/>I will be doing a lot of animating soon.<br/><br/>Let's address another date in April. Not the one marking a shitty holiday no one cares about, forcing big corporations to feel obliged to foist weaksauce stunts on everybody, revealing their PR departments to be stocked with wannabe writers for The Onion. No this shit is SERIOUS. We are talking about April 13th, exactly one year since Homestuck began. The original plan was to end the story on this date. (A plan which predated the first page of this monsterpiece. A plan thus rooted in peril and ignorance!) My plan has managed to deescalate in its sweeping architecture and now reads as \"do a really kickass animation, if you have time.\" The plan also includes shoehorning a couple other kickass animations into the archives between now and then. <br/><br/>Will I have time? Only I can answer that question. The likelihood for an affirmative is gravely influenced by the measure of abuse I will cause myself to endure. This measure is forecast to be: <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;\">CONSIDERABLE</span><br/><br/>At the very least this announcement will chronicle with some precision the standard I have set myself up to fail to live up to, so hey, we're accomplishing stuff here.<br/><br/>Humor is dying a slow death cause everyone's trying to be so funny so hard at me all the time. Everybody pipe down and sell me shit. \n"

I was going to do a couple animations before 4/13, and then a BIG ONE on the day of 4/13, the one year anniversary of Homestuck's starting date. My schedule is not going to permit this though. <a href=\"http://www.moccany.com/\" target=\"_blank\">I'm going away this weekend</a>, and as anyone who travels knows, that will consume a block of time greater than the span of the travel dates themselves. It will screw me up way too much to be in super-crazy production mode. I can pull off regular-crazy production mode, but note super-crazy. In summary, this week is toast. And in any case, there's really no reason to rush this thing just to squeeze something critical into a meaningless date.<br/><br/>So instead I will do ONE animation, take my time with it, and post it on 4/13. That will be the next update you will see.<br/><br/>Then after that I will move it along to the end of the act. I will still post the animation I was originally planning to post on 4/13, but at a somewhat later date. There won't be much ambiguity here. When I do post it, you will know exactly which date this animation was originally slated for.<br/><br/>But the good news is I think we can get the Volume 4 album out on 4/13. Keep an ear out for it.<br/><br/>So as long as we're here with almost a year's worth of HS under our belts, why don't we hit pause and check our game status.<br/><br/>Homestuck:<br/><br/>4 kids <br/>365 days (and counting)<br/>1667 pages (+1 on day 365)<br/>2024 images<br/>85,000 words<br/>62 Flash animations (+1 on day 365)<br/>5.5 images per day, every day<br/>1 Flash animation every 6 days<br/><br/>Some Flash data:<br/>1 hour total of animated footage <br/>3000 imported graphic files<br/>53 songs<br/>3 albums (+1 on day 365)<br/><br/>1 <a href=\"/mspa/001953\" target=\"_blank\">sacred urns toppled</a><br/>1 <a href=\"/mspa/003259\" target=\"_blank\">mystic ruins desecrated</a><br/>1 <a href=\"/mspa/002314\" target=\"_blank\">hallowed tombs defiled</a><br/><br/>15 Sweet Bro and Hella Jeffs<br/><br/>---------------<br/><br/><a href=\"/blogspot/end-of-problem-sleuth\" target=\"_blank\">The Problem Sleuth data</a>, for your convenience:<br/><br/>3 detectives<br/>365 days<br/>1621 pages<br/>1915 images<br/>45,000 words<br/>0 sacred urns toppled<br/>0 mystic ruins desecrated<br/>0 hallowed tombs defiled<br/><br/>I remember writing after finishing PS that I didn't really notice the effort involved over the course of the year. That is very far from the truth this time. Believe me, this felt like a serious undertaking. Clearly I not only surpassed my previous page counts in less time, but added major animation chores on top of all that, which proved to be the most labor intensive part of it! Even disregarding the animation, the extra detail in the the static pages, the larger environments, the heavier use of color, the more rigorous character design and game mechanics, the doubled word count, it all added up to something much bigger than PS. Then pile huge Flash projects on top of all that and you have something that's certifiably insane. The good news is that I got faster the more I challenged myself.<br/><br/>I've easily worked twice as much on HS as I did on PS. Probably more. There have been more all-day-all-night affairs than I could count. Weekend breaks mostly nonexistent. I just don't recall that sort of relentless exertion during Problem Sleuth, except maybe during the final moments of the battle. Even the whole Sepulchritude thing strikes me as a pretty quaint endeavor now. That would really just be a run of the mill battle animation these days. <br/><br/>Why am I jumping the gun and reviewing this all now rather than on 4/13? Probably because I know I won't feel like it by then, just after I post an animation, and with more to do right away. This isn't QUITE as monumental as the PS year-end spectacular, since obviously the story's just going to keep going. To be honest, I feel like recently Homestuck has been just starting to warm up. Let's see how she handles in year two.<br/><br/>Anyway, I got work to do. See ya.\n"

There will be more to hear from this guy soon. His work is colorful, energetic, and generated with absurd prolificity.

(1:29)  It's from a song recorded exactly 100 years prior to Homestuck.

Not only does it help move these things along faster, but it adds some nice visual depth to the productions.<br/><br/>If you're wondering whether this animation (WV?: Rise up.) was going to be the original 4/13 one, the answer's still no. That'll be the next one. I was originally going to squeeze this series of animations into like a week and a half period before 4/13, with more compressed action than has occurred since that date.<br/><br/>Of course once I bailed on that plan, I just decided to stretch things way out, because it was just easier that way. I think this is one of the secrets to the vast size of these stories. Making big plot advancing strides in shorter periods of time, through animation etc, is actually more difficult than spreading it out. So as long as it's spread out, I fill that space with massive amounts of simpler pages, and it all just piles up.<br/><br/>tl;dr: MORE STORY. LESS WORK. Weird.\n"

I'll start working on that soon. I'm stretching out and taking my time on stuff. All the while posting like a million pages which sort of makes no sense.

So much better.</h3>\nEarlier I mentioned I used artwork from contributors in the latest animation. <a href=\"/credits/artcredits\" target=\"_blank\">These guys right here.</a> A real fine bunch of artists. I recommend you check out the stuff they've got on their respective web catalogues.<br/><br/>Working with a bigger pool of people for a change was a lot of fun, and I am quite sure improved the final product. I'm still not sure exactly how much time the collaboration saved. Between orchestrating it all, prepping a million graphics and finagling with Flash for days straight, it's still a ton of work. I think the primary benefit here is it adds a lot of visual richness. Where before I would cut a lot of corners and recycle a lot more graphics, or just never even bother implementing certain scenes, this time I had quite a diversity of nice art assets to grab, and build the action around, and I think it paid off nicely. So thanks guys! Looking forward to next time.<br/><br/>Also, more about the song. Toby made this months ago in anticipation of some epic pandemonium going down on 4/13. Obviously that whole thing got delayed, and plans changed. But I always held on to it for EOA purposes and now here it is. What may be interesting for people to realize is how especially formative the song was to the action and story events in this page. It wasn't like I said \"Hey Toby make this ridiculously awesome long ass song that switches up themes every 30 seconds or so, and also put a silly Squiddles interlude in there ok?\" Nope, he just made it out of the blue, and I had months to think about how I'd adapt something to it. He didn't have the slightest idea what I'd do with it of course. But the result is this kind of odd musical storyboarding process. By composing the song he was sort of storyboarding the thing for me, or at least forcing my hand to address the musical themes at each step of the piece. The challenge was to pull everything together into a narrative that made sense, match the music switches, and cap off the act logically and compellingly within that prearranged structure. Constraints are a good thing. They invite creativity. I wouldn't want to be an absolute dictator on every facet of this project. I've never said, \"Listen up guys I need a song and I need it to go EXACTLY like this.\" I tried to keep it pretty loose with the artists too. I just gave them some broad concepts to work with, and let them get creative with it. Some environments, some characters, etc. Practically no descriptions of specific events. They were as surprised as anyone else to see the outcome of the animation. They were probably surprised to see exactly to what extent I scribbled all over their nice drawings, setting them on fire and blasting holes in things.<br/><br/>Ok speaking of music, there's going to be a new album out soon. \"But haven't there only been like three songs since the last one?\" you say? Let me worry about that. There'll be plenty to listen to.<br/><br/>When? I'll probably spring it right around the launch of the next act.<br/><br/>When's the next act start? I was thinking of starting Act 5 on 6/12 to make some time to prepare some stuff, and take care of a few other things I guess. I'll probably slip some twixt-act updates in too. Not any sort of intermission though.\n"

I thought this would be a much tidier container for all these crazy music projects we're cranking out. Oh and there will be more.<br/><br/>The idea I had for volume five was to gather up a lot of music that had been accumulating, and stuff it all into this monster album. Like, WAY more songs than would ever be sensible to put in an album and still call it an album. The result is something so audacious, it just might be COMPLETELY MINDBLOWINGLY INCREDIBLE. You be the judge. I already know your verdict though.<br/><br/>Additionally the concept was to make a huge soundtrack that touches on the magnitude of the story that has been swelling steadily for more than a year. The soundtrack is meant to evoke all the things taking place that we perhaps aren't seeing in this universe, or that could happen, but that the linear focus of the narrative simply can't contain. You're invited to imagine the bigger story the album is telling.<br/><br/>Bear in mind this album is not merely a giant song dump. I feel like I arranged this mix pretty carefully. And on top of that, <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">it is a seamless album</span>. There are transitions between songs built into the songs, so it all runs together as a cohesive whole. It's all equalized and mastered very well. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">There is nearly three solid hours of music to listen to</span>. And it is less than fifteen dollars.<br/><br/>Now it seems like I can never release one of these things without thanking my knuckles to a bloody pulp as I rain blows of merciless gratitude on everyone around me, and for good reason. Lots of people worked their asses off on this thing. It always seems like such a simple idea. Hey lets make an album! All this music is right here it'll take like two seconds to ram it out. Wrong stupid! So here I am assuming the flying crane position of indebtedness while I meditate on the fact that I'm about to snap the spines of fifty helpless thank ninjas in cold blooded succession. <br/><br/>Thanks to Cindy who worked forever on the new website and uploaded a million giant high quality songs which take forever to upload as it turns out and also hounding everyone for their files and stuff. Thanks to Clark Powell for doing great mastering/equalizing work on all the songs, and thanks to Toby Fox for doing <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">additionally great</span> work of a similar nature. Thanks to all the musicians for lighting a fire under their bone bulges to get high quality files to us and of course not being able to help themselves from making all these killer upgrades to the music itself in the process. And thanks to Lexxy for the ultraslick cover art!<br/><br/>I am never going to stop listening to this thing. Never. They'll have to send the cadaver dogs into my fucking unibomber shack cause I ain't coming out, and the fire ants will be wondering how they're gonna eat the rotting pulp in my skull with these headphones blocking my earholes like that.\n"

I believe you will find this album shall only further crystallize the atmosphere of this arc. It will do this because we say it will. <br/><br/>But there is some trivia here! Before I started act 5, Toby talked to me about working on an album like this, couched in the assumption that the troll story would never be examined in the detail it is presently, and that this album would only serve as a tonal exploration of a purely hypothetical adventure supplied by the imagination. Turns out he assumed incorrectly! Which only made the project that much more timely and apropos. In fact, the planet Alternia was named after the album, and not the other way around!<br/><br/>This is really good stuff. It should go without saying that Radiation's work is always among my personal TOP PIX. This is obvious, since I have leaned heavily on him for HS scoring. Leaned hard.

My only objective here is to reduce the clutter somewhat. Some of the content I wiped out, particularly to the side, I'm sure I'll reintroduce in some more rational way a little later. I'll chip away at it. Site design is something I never get around to on account of its tedium and the fact that I'd rather use my energy drawing. And since I can't at the moment, well... I still almost didn't bother. But then I did bother.<br/><br/>This week long drought wasn't so much about taking a break from drawing as it was an extension of two simple facts - I was away from my computer, and being away from my computer makes updating impossible. That SPECIFIC machine, and not this one on which I type or any other, is essentially the physical embodiment of this website. Really if I could be updating while away I would be. This trip isn't about rest. That's for losers. The hiatus was and is a referendum on corporeality, and its usurious demands on the virtual. It appears, as I am learning, that I, the author of this website, am a corporeal thing, and it turns out my computer is corporeal as well. We can be separated into compartments completely isolated from one another, compartments often referred to by the natives as \"locations\". This blew my mind. The hiatus is also a referendum on culture shock.<br/><br/>Hey! How about some more updates soon? Ok. How about tomorrow evening? That will be after I get into this huge metal thing. After the metal thing makes LOTS AND LOTS of noise, I will step out, and when I do, my computer will be not as... hang on while I flip through my Glossary of the Corporeal. Man this thing is handy. Ah yes... \"Far away.\"\n"

I asked her to draw them and she did. Girls are so much better at thinking up fancy clothes than boys. Ask anybody! It is a fact.<br/><br/>In case you didn't know, recently the <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/\" target=\"_blank\">forums</a> were ported to a different machine to reduce the gluttonous demands on this server. It was also nicely refurbished in the process. This was quite an undertaking, and a bunch of cool people pitched in and made it happen. Especially major thanks to Brian for doing if not 90% of the work, then well over 100% of it. He wrestled it to the ground like a frisky steer that had no concept of its own strength and now we are all sitting around enjoying hamburgers. Yes, that taste in your mouth WAS fresh beef.<br/><br/>Even so, this server still has some problems. If you're really glued to this site, you probably notice the Fedora test page appear just before an update comes up. That is because I have to shut the WHOLE SITE DOWN just to get my update php script to run. But really this is mostly because the script I wrote years ago is SO SHITTY, so it's my own fault. It wasn't built to run smoothly on a well trafficked machine, nor to publish such a long story. I'd rewrite it, but I really can't stand coding anymore. She is a bitter divorcee and has nothing but scorn for me. Every time I look at my code I sink into a deep depression and then draw like 50 pages to drown my sorrows while I try not to think of dollar signs and semicolons and SQL statements. <br/><br/>What else is there to talk about. Oh yeah. New album soon? Seems like only yesterday we put out <a href=\"/music/album/alternia\" target=\"_blank\">Alternia</a>. But you bet there's one in the pipeline. This one involves more fun times than are sensible to contemplate sober. Also there will be bonus animation to go along with it. You'll see.<br/><br/>Speaking of Alternia, the troll arc is predictably lasting longer than predicted. But that's ok. It's kind of like Inception, and we started having a dream of trolls inside a dream of kids, but then forgot we were dreaming, and now it's just all about trolls. But don't worry, we'll get back there. I like to think the kids are on summer break, and these alien kids are who we get to hang out with in the mean time. That's a fun way to look at it.<br/><br/>Have you ever thought about <a href=\"/sbahj/4\" target=\"_blank\">Barack Obana</a> and thought it would be totally cool to follow him on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/BarackObana\" target=\"_blank\">twitter</a>? I wouldn't even believe you if you didn't say you did. So just please just shut up and try to don't say it ok.<br/><br/>Oh yeah take a look at the <a href=\"http://s839.photobucket.com/albums/zz317/ellesterotakon2010/mspa%20peeps/\" target=\"_blank\">mischief some people</a> get up to. Who is supervising these rogues?? They are out of control. I think everybody should dress up as Homestuck characters, ALL THE TIME. This is the world I pine to inhabit, and these hooligans and their patio masquerade are the vanguard of my dreamscape.\n"

He has a new project called <a href=\"http://www.epicsplosion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Epicsplosion</a> which looks rather exciting, and if you enjoy the content on this site you will likely agree. It uses a similar format to MSPA, though with considerably more polish applied to the panels and overall presentation. And most interestingly (IMO!) he's going for a true \"choose your own adventure\" format, with branching story paths. This is something I tried with MSPA in the early going with <a href=\"/mspa/2\" target=\"_blank\">Bard Quest</a>, and in fact it was originally going to be one of the defining features of this site. But it proved to be pretty challenging to keep up with multiple story paths in any non-trivial way, so I just proceeded linearly with PS and HS thereafter.<br/><br/>While he was preparing to work on this, he and I talked a bit about the various challenges and pitfalls of the medium. I think he's chiseled the approach down to something pretty effective and manageable, and certainly the result is attractive. Personally I hope he keeps up with this, because it could turn into something pretty fantastic. The best way to keep him motivated I suspect is for us all to show support with our keen and frequent attention!<br/><br/>Hey, speaking of bros who I've been bros with forever, I also noticed <a href=\"http://www.firmanproductions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Michael</a> is selling custom comics at a bargain price. Seize on this opportunity or know the meaning of lifelong regret. In case it wasn't clear, Moe is the best webcomic on the internet. Period.<br/><br/>ALSO speaking of bros, thanks a ton to Matthew for helping me out with the update script I was having problems with. Now posting an update <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">DOESN'T</span> require me shutting down the whole site for 15 minutes. This is a major advancement!\n"

Check it out. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20101215012041/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/store/trollshirts.html\" target=\"_blank\">You can buy troll shirts</a> and dress like your favorite troll, and/or don your colorful zodiac sign of choice. Pretty neat!<br/><br/>There'll be a <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">pre-order phase of two weeks</span>. Considering this is a TON of unique shirt designs and presents a stocking challenge, I'd like to get a sense of how many of each type people want before making them. <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Important: pre-ordering is the only way to get certain sizes!</span> Like the smaller or bigger sizes. After pre-order's closed, all you can get will be more standard sizes. So if one of those sizes is your cup of tea, better hop on this soon!<br/><br/>Now that this whole ensemble of silly characters and their escapades are out in the open, I felt like a decent number of people would enjoy the opportunity to grab an OFFICIAL shirt bearing one of these simple, striking designs which are also recognizable to those with the lowdown on astrology. Who knew that tying the zodiac to a bunch of angry alien kids was the only way to make it cool? I sure didn't. Also, if you are planning to do some cosplaying, I don't know how the HELL you think you are going to pull it off without one of these shirts. I really don't.<br/><br/>This is something I'm handling outside of the elegant <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa\" target=\"_blank\">Topatoco framework</a>, for a number of tactical reasons. One, flooding my storefront suddenly with 12 unique designs sounds kinda clumsy. Two, I'm really not sure how many each of these would sell since there are so many different designs to pick from. They stay so busy making shirts for tons of artists that I like to try to be sure designs I send them will have a ghost of a chance of being worth their hassle sales-wise. So I'm riding herd on this myself along with my Chief Corporate Officer of Strategic Corporate Actualization Strategies and Paradigm Corporatizations, and together we will do it guerrilla style with paypallery and homespun mailing shenanigans. <br/><br/>Sellin' stuff is fun!<br/><br/>Not as fun as buyin' it though. ;-)\n"

No, your guess is wrong. It is a <a href=\"/music/album/squiddles\" target=\"_blank\">Squiddles album</a>. Surprise!<br/><br/> <a href=\"/music/album/squiddles\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Squiddles!\" src=\"/archive/social/news/squiddles_cover.gif\"/></a><br/><br/>Here is an important thing to note before all else. <a href=\"/squiddles\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\" target=\"_blank\">This album comes with a full-length animation!</a> That is a link to the trailer. The full version comes with the download.<br/><br/>A lot of the same <a href=\"/squiddles\" target=\"_blank\">people</a> who have contributed to MSPA animations lately worked on that animation. In fact, they did 100% of it! Conceptualized it and storyboarded it and drew all the assets, all under the supervision of a very skilled Flash animator named Peter Turner. <br/><br/>This album began percolating many months ago, and as with much of what this music fellowship works on, it snowballed in quantity and silliness and awesomeness over an extended period of time. It began with <span class=\"style7\">Alexander Rosetti's great single track (1st in playlist), a snippet of which found its way into the big [S] Descend mashup</span>. <br/><br/>The idea we formed around that song was to make an album that would serve as the soundtrack for a fictional cartoon show for kids, full of ridiculous happy tunes with strong themes of friendship and chock full of squeaky noises and aquatic gurglings. Seems to me like they pulled it off. It's very easy to picture this as a real show now!<br/><br/>Most of what you hear and see is musician/artist-conceptualized. I didn't have much of a hand in it other than the original idea. The guiding principle for working on Squiddles stuff is, any idea someone has for it automatically becomes Squiddles canon. So really anything going on here, candy corn shrimp, skipper Plumbthroat's connivings, underwater unicorns, all that came together through the collaboration of these artists while I sat quietly and boggled vacantly at their shenanigans. These guys are a bunch of nuts. But they are <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">your </span>nuts, and now their work is yours as well.<br/><br/>Go buy this (<span style=\"font-style: italic;\">cheap!</span>) album and have yourself a friendship aneurysm. \n"

I'm fairly sure he is one of the fastest Flash programmers in the world. To put this in perspective, he programmed this whole thing over the weekend, while<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> still allowing time for Con Air breaks</span>.<br/><br/>The <a href=\"/credits/artcredits\" target=\"_blank\">folks pitching in artwork</a> were pivotal in forming the look that was achieved. I was responsible for very little artwork here. I built levels out of tiles and other assets, wrote it and guided its production, but the visuals were primarily supplied and conceived by them. Specifically I should make mention of <a href=\"http://www.iwantyoutofeelthepressure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">M Thomas Harding</a>, who helped drive the production of assets pretty hard and played a big part in developing a style for the sprites meant to be reminiscent of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound\" target=\"_blank\">Earthbound</a>, a game which has always been a major influence behind Homestuck. And <a href=\"http://proffate.deviantart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Turner</a>, who designed a ton of tile sets for level building, as well as a lot of the more detailed graphics, like the monsters and lab equipment.<br/><br/><a href=\"/credits/soundcredits\" target=\"_blank\">Musically</a>, Toby Fox has got it mostly covered. I originally asked him to just dust off a few tracks from his <a href=\"/music/album/alternia\" target=\"_blank\">Alternia album</a>, make them loopable for gameplay, to get those into the mix of the story. But predictably he did one better than that and refined them into new compositions, and added some more swell silly stuff on top of it (e.g. the Cage Theatrics). There's also some really great stuff by a few other guys to be found in <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">the secret room</span>.<br/><br/>What? There's a secret room?? Well, there are a few, but there's one <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">secret </span>secret room. I won't tell you how to find it, because then it would be a dumb secret. Just ask around. See what the word is on \"the street\". You'll figure it out.\n"

It all depends on how much you feel like making guys like <a href=\"http://gunshowcomic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">KC Green</a> and <a href=\"http://lucid-tv.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Keogh</a> take a shirt into a dark room to verify this. I don't know what else to tell you really.<br/><br/>This is just the kind of thing we all have to deal with when a guy is allowed to produce merchandise for the shittiest comic ever made.\n"

I was really impressed with his stuff, so a while ago asked him to put together an album. We talked about it and thought it would be cool to make a bunch of battle music for hypothetical STRIFE pages. I think two words that adequately describe how it came out are holy shit. His rock sound is sick, incredibly polished and well produced. You'll hear more from him for sure. (And in fact, you just did! He made the Mexican Standoff tune in the new Flash page.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSpeaking of sick, check the <a href=\"/scraps2/strifealbumcover.gif\" target=\"_blank\">cover art</a> by <a href=\"http://www.epicsplosion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tauhid.</a> The dude can draw.

The sound guys have a lot of good stuff to share. I'm thinking of doing an \"Artist of the Month\" thing, in addition to continue to release the more general story albums. I guess what I'm saying is - MORE MUSIC FOR YOU. I'm trying to keep these pretty cheap. $4.13's a good number. Get used to seeing it! (as if you aren't already)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOn PURCHASABLE PRODUCTS: Aaargh, I should have said earlier that last time I announced the restock, we sold out of shit again pretty much on that same day. Oops. There will be more VERY soon, plus we're trying to put in motion getting some COOL GOD TIER HOODIES off the ground, cause I know a bunch of people have been asking about that.

I believe the ongoing calamity in Japan presents such an opportunity for us all to help. So here is my idea for how we can raise money to donate to relief efforts. SQUIDDLES FOR JAPAN!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"Squiddles!\" src=\"/archive/social/news/charitysquiddles.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nFor a <b>minimum donation of $100</b>, you can buy <b>one pair of plush squiddles</b>, and we will ship them to you. $100 is the minimum, but you may donate more, and are certainly encouraged to since every dollar donated will go to charity. There are only 20 pairs available. They come in a variety of colors, more than those shown in the photo. We will choose the colors you get. It will be a surprise!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.metroidhat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eyes5</a> made this batch for me a while ago, and they're quite nice. I considered selling them, but held off, since I figured people might find the very limited supply a bit frustrating. I think this is a better way to apply this friendly tangled mass. The high price reflecting limited supply is much more justifiable to me when it is for charity.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf these sell out quickly, I may think of another way to reward those who wish to donate for something. We'll see how this goes. But if that's a bit much for you to afford, or they sell out or whatever, I'd urge you to think about <a href=\"http://www.google.co.jp/intl/en/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html\" target=\"_blank\">contributing what you can</a> regardless. The consequences of the disaster aren't going away! Even though it was more than a week ago, it keeps being terrible.\n"

Clark has a great ambient sound, and his idea for the album was to musically express the Medium's planets, through both their elements and themes. I think he nailed it. Cover art was tag-teamed by me and Cindy (the lady who touches all your WP shirts).\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAlso: <span style=\"color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;\">New Topatoco items!</span>\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Hoodies\" src=\"/archive/social/news/sbahj_and_hoodie.gif\"/></a>\n<br/><br/>\n\nFirst of all, you will notice there are two new <a href=\"/sbahj\" target=\"_blank\">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff</a> shirts. People are always coming up to me and saying \"we NEED more insanely shitty looking shirts to wear to places like <a href=\"/sbahj/27\" target=\"_blank\">church</a> and stuff.\" What choice to I have but to serve these rowdy individuals with dollars in their hands and outstanding taste in their opinions???\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIn truth, <a href=\"http://wigucomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey</a> and I cannot help ourselves from attempting to capitalize on this nonsense, because we both need aggressive psychiatric examination. But if you don't buy these shirts, we will both feel ashamed and foolish. Please buy these shirts. I'm begging you. If you don't, we will probably weep in each others arms, swaddled in an orange heap of 3000 dunking Big Men. As an incentive, I will make this solemn pledge. If I sell out of all of these SBaHJ shirts within a week, you are guaranteed to discover that I have permanently emblazoned SBaHJ iconography on my body somewhere, with real, honest to gog foreverink. You'll wonder how high I even will have had to have been. Fact. 8^y\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAlso note the classy <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-sepulch-hood\" target=\"_blank\">Sepulchritude hoodie</a>, perfect complement to your <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-sepulch\" target=\"_blank\">Sepulchritude tee</a>. I will be coming out with HS god tier hoodies soon through What Pumpkin, and I thought that as long as such garments were being offered, it would be nice to have a Problem Sleuth one in the mix too. Plus, the godhoods won't have zipper fronts, and this one does. So if you like to zip up, like if that's your thing, then this is for you.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>4/13/11</b>\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe two year anniversary of HS has come and gone. Not as much fanfare in-story about it as I'd hoped, but at least it got a nod. Remember when games came on multiple disks? You always were asked to swap during a kind of peculiar and underwhelming moment, like walking through a thing, or talking to a guy. Sometimes it was shortly after you got an <a href=\"/mspa/005589\" target=\"_blank\">airship</a>, or something. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI had plans to do something a little more mesmerizing, like <a href=\"/mspa/003568\" target=\"_blank\">last year</a>, but started running out of time. So I revised the plans, then ran out of time for THOSE too. And so on, til I said screw it. Disc 1 probably wouldn't have been able to fit another hefty animation in it anyway. Those discs are only like what, 700 MB??\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIt takes a lot to meet a deadline coming up fast, when the thing you are planning is meant to be a BIG DEAL, by definition. First you must come up with an animation idea, and that itself will take a long time to make. Then you must move the story along to the exact precipice of that moment, which also takes time, and must do so with enough time left to animate! Plenty of ways to blow it. Making this story on the fly requires not just a lot of drawing and writing, but the sensibilities of a producer. Knowing when to appropriate large amounts of effort for what purposes given various time constraints. I make adjustments to plans all the time, just like I did with the last 4/13 milestone (was originally scheduling end of act 4 for that). Hence this milestone was less jaw dropping, but then if you recall, the <a href=\"/mspa/001901\" target=\"_blank\">original 4/13 celebration</a> was pretty underwhelming too. What will next 4/13 bring? Guess we'll see.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf I'm taking the time to reflect on two years of Homestuck as an achievement I'll do so here only as a gesture of gratitude to the steadfast readers, new and old. I am humbled by your devotion. This is not any sort of platitude to be dismissed as quasi-sincere acceptance speech fodder, or a dispatch from my PR department because sometimes you guys give me money for stuff. This is sincerely true. I look around and still cannot quite believe the magnitude of the enthusiasm that surrounds this story. I stopped being able to keep track of all the fan art for it more than a year ago, and even then there were thousands of fan-made images I would diligently attempt to pore through. I have honestly never seen so much fan art created for anything, anywhere, ever. Even things which have millions of dollars backing their production budgets. Maybe Harry Potter has more? (Alright let's get real. HS fan art is probably just now beginning to approach the subset of drawings that involve Harry being naked with somebody.) Greater and greater hordes of troll cosplayers can be spotted taking over the floors of conventions. You could have pressed me on the subject, but I never would have guessed anyone could be quite so <i>tickled</i> to be slathered in messy gray makeup and crowned by a homemade pair of horns. There is this seething passion for HS that is a self-organizing, autonomous entity unto itself, which is practically inaccessible to my understanding or involvement, even though I'm responsible for the content driving it. I've kept Homestuck's fire hot; its gaping furnace was hungry for coal so I got goddamn shoveling. But you have been responsible for breathing life into this monstrous organism which surrounds me, and now in its breadth transcends my work entirely. To thank you as a whole for this phenomenon almost doesn't sound rational. It's like thanking a furious thunderstorm for the deluge of rain it gave to your thirsty little box of poseys. My paltry utterance dissipates in the far deep rumbling. The clouds don't even notice I'm there because they're too busy swapping fan fiction. Maybe instead I'll offer something more significant than gratitude. Something more personal and experiential. I'll submit my amazement. You can't see me now, but it is a look of wonder and discovery. A boyish look of astonishment at something remarkable beyond words, like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon, but on a more cosmic scale and more viscerally shocking. Like a squealing horrorterror's gruesome Cesarean birth. That is the look I have every time I disrupt the tunnel vision that keeps the work's bright sun searing my eyes. When they adjust to the dark, I see the silhouette in soft black focus of the young planet sized monster, chirping its affections. I offer it this look because it is all I have to give, with the exception of the tears streaming down my face. Its hunger is piqued at the fluid and my only regret is I can never possibly provide enough to nourish the orphan, now that it can never know the taste of its dead mother's heinous teatbrine.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOr...\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOr I could just say thanks guys.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nLET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN YEAR THREE!!!!!!!!\n"

I hope to add more to this page gradually.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd one last point on the store. Please take notice of the <a href=\"http://mspwps.kayako.com/\" target=\"_blank\">new support system</a>. If you have a question or a problem with an order, please go through that! The old What Pumpkin email address has gotten swamped with so many different types of correspondence, it's become very difficult to field support cases through it. If you use the new system, rapid satisfaction is considerably more likely!\n"

Bowman</a> has done a lot to shape the sound of Homestuck. Among his contributions were Explore and Sburban Jungle (end of acts 2 and 3 music). He is also a mastermind behind the ambitious <a href=\"http://www.iambowman.com/hareforceone/\" target=\"_blank\">Hare Force One</a> project (people ship Con Air bunnies to each other all over the globe). For his album, he has created two characters whose names are featured in the title. They exist somewhere in the Homestuck universe, playing their own session, and each song captures something about their adventure. See his <a href=\"http://www.iambowman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> for what he has to say about it personally. I think it's a really fun and creative album with a fantastic sound.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://taviamorra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tavia Morra</a> and <a href=\"http://notenoughink.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Gung</a>, both art team contributors, worked on the art for this album together.

Some from the stable of Flash contributors with whom we're familiar, and some from people who are just <i>out there</i>, whipping up awesome things by dint of self-propelled moxie alone. Buying these is an even more tangible, fiscally measurable way to show them support beyond reblogging their tumblrs. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAlso, check out these really cool pins!

Along with many other musics.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"/music/album/homestuck-vol-8\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Volume 8\" src=\"/archive/social/news/vol8coverthumb.jpg\"/></a>\n<br/><br/>\n\nSoon I would like to get together some wallpapers comprised of many or the art assets contributed for this, and offer those as well.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThat's it for now. More announcements soon.\n"

Look at what happened while I was away:\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/books\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Homestuck Books\" src=\"/archive/social/news/HSbook2banners.jpg\"/></a>\n<br/><br/>\n\nYou can either get book 2 on its own, or in a nice funpak full of numerous books. There was briefly an offer for signed + <a href=\"/tumblr/softowl-ipgd-softowl-derples-a-little\" target=\"_blank\">stamped</a> books, but those ran out pretty quickly. Sorry if you missed the chance, but I have to cap the number of cutomized books so I don't get impossibly inundated. There will surely be opportunities for signed + stamped and/or sketched books in the future.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThese books are turning out to be a nice way to access the story, in my view. Probably better than I expected. Even though they sacrifice some elements like animation, to me there will always be something more inviting about flipping through a book than staring for hours at a screen, no matter what sort of magic a screen is capable of. So far the tradeoffs have been worthwhile to make this collection. This one is a little more refined in its layout (as well as 100 pages thicker) than the first one. <a href=\"http://www.kallini.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris</a> has been doing a good job putting these together. I expect them to keep getting better as we go. Also, don't forget each book includes hundreds of author notes. Some of these notes are even informative. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSome brief points in the FAQ department before I go: Book 2 contains all of act 2. So yes, book 3 will contain all of act 3 plus the intermission. Book 4 will contain act 4. Then we'll see what happens. I'll try to get book 3 out with Topatoco's batch of fall releases.\n"

There will be exactly three pauses. Two of them will be related to animation. The third will not.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nPAUSE ONE: This starts RIGHT NOW! (July 1st) I will use this time to work on the first animation. I have to travel to <a href=\"http://www.comic-con.org/cci/\" target=\"_blank\">SDCC</a> on July 11th. It's very likely I will finish the animation before that. Once I post it, pause two will begin.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nPAUSE TWO: I will use this time to work on another animation, to end A6A3. It will definitely be longer than pause 1, because it will include my trip to SDCC. That trip will kill an entire week of animation time. I'll likely have to start work on it when I get back. Cross country travel is preposterously disruptive, and it's going to slow everything down.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nPAUSE THREE: This will begin immediately after pause two. It will not involve working on animation. I'm reserving this time to catch up on the huge amount of chores I've been badly neglecting, and will continue to badly neglect during pauses 1 and 2. The irony of animation pauses: you see nothing for many days, but I'm working at least twice as hard, doing nothing else. It's a break for you, but an anti-break for me. So I need to schedule an ACTUAL break to do stuff that needs doing. Book work, plus tons of other things. I don't know how long this pause will be yet. Probably longer than either of the first two. Let's look at it sort of like the end of a \"season\", where the season was all of act 6 so far.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe bottom line is, this is all going to add up to a whole lot of \"me not updating Homestuck\" for a while. It's not really what I want, but there's just no way around it.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI guess that's all there is to say for now. See you after pause one!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nEdit: wait, something else I wanted to mention. Recently some music team guys helped me update the <a href=\"/credits/soundcredits\" target=\"_blank\">sound credits page</a>, so that each entry links to the song in an album. That way, for any Flash page, it's easy to find out exactly where that song is on <a href=\"/music\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>. For those newer to the site, I suspect this may be helpful.\n"

It is just layers upon layers with these pauses. They are like onions, especially insofar as they result in your tears.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI wish the last week could have been dedicated to animation labors to shorten this wait, but I was in California fraternizing with radical fans of my popular web cartoon.

(A <a href=\"/scraps2/A6I3walkthrough.gif\" target=\"_blank\">walkthrough</a> by Radiation.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFirst, I'd originally planned to put more in the game than this, but it was running a bit long, so I decided to chop it up. I'm planning two more installments of this game, probably to be released over the next couple weeks. All the art assets and stuff is there, I just need to work with Alexis to crunch it all into a couple more new games.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSpeaking of which, thanks to Alexis, MSPA's tenured CODER OF GAMES, for working on this. It's a little different. It's the first time we're not using Flash. Only the intro is Flash, but the game is coded in HTML5, which makes it a little more robust in some ways, but will have some issues with less common browsers. I've copied <a href=\"/tumblr/im-copying-a-message-here-from-alexis-who\" target=\"_blank\">a note</a> from him about it all here. Take note especially of browser info: best viewed in Chrome, Firefox is ok but not ideal, IE is very buggy and won't show the Flash intro, and Opera/Safari aren't tested at all.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThanks to <a href=\"/credits/artcredits\" target=\"_blank\">the artists</a> (scroll to bottom) who worked on assets for this too. They've made a good deal more than you see here, which will appear in other installments. Thanks Stephen, Tanney, Peter, Amanda for making environment assets, and Chaz, Lexxy, Vivus, Xamag for the talking portraits. Special thanks to <a href=\"http://merrigo.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda</a> for making all the little walking sprites, as well as a whole lot of environment stuff and items. Everything looks really great.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd of course, thanks to contributing <a href=\"/credits/soundcredits\" target=\"_blank\">musicians</a> (again scroll to bottom), and Toby for editing everything. Some things from the contest album Universe A, notably <a href=\"/music/track/fuchsia-ruler\" target=\"_blank\">Fuscia Ruler</a> by Sinister Psyche as the main song.

The response to it continues to be fantastic, and my gratitude to the backers is equally continuous. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThanks to everyone who beta tested the <a href=\"/mspa/007208\" target=\"_blank\">recent update</a> in advance of its release. Anyone who pledged $50 or more was sent an early beta version and a feedback form to help us sort out the bugs. The same offer will apply for the next and final minigame installment. If you have pledged $50 or more by the end of the Kickstarter, you'll get an advance copy to test sent through the Kickstarter message system. If you pledge, just be sure you select a reward tier at $55 or more, so that we know to send you a copy. (Note this is unrelated to the $1.5MM stretch goal, which states that ALL BACKERS will be allowed to beta test the adventure game itself, before it is released in 2014.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAlso, once the Kickstarter is over, we're going to put up a Paypal pledging option for the project. A lot of people seem to only be able to use Paypal to pledge, which Kickstarter doesn't allow. So for a brief window after, one or two weeks, you'll be able to pledge via Paypal for the same reward tiers at the same prices. The window will be fairly short so that we can compile all the orders and ship the rewards out in a timely fashion. We're expecting a good number of people may want things to ship in time for the holiday season. If you're in the U.S. or Canada, it's very likely this will be the case. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFor those who haven't pledged yet, this might be something to consider. The timing of the shipping here means that buying rewards could actually double as holiday shopping. If you see yourself doing holiday shopping for people a couple months down the road anyway, this might be a good advance opportunity. A lot of those pricier bundles start to pile up so much extra cool stuff, seems to me this makes for a good chance to divvy them up as holiday gifts for friends, maybe some of whom didn't have enough money for the bigger bundles. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhatever the final total winds up being, you have already helped make this Kickstarter an overwhelming success. Thank you again for your support!\n"

I think we can all agree that is quite a haul, and is a testament to the devotion of Homestuck's amazing fans. I truly believe this funding will result in a fantastic game, and I can't wait to get started on it. Thanks again to those who pledged, as well as those who continue to pledge through the <a href=\"http://whatpumpkin.com/kickstarter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paypal option</a> which is now available. It offers all the same reward tiers, and should stay up for a couple weeks.  \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThanks also to those who helped me organize and run this Kickstarter, which was a significant undertaking. In particular, George for supplying the Kickstarter knowhow, Rachel for fielding the many thousands of questions we received, and Cindy for getting the huge amount of rewards in shape and ready to ship. Delivering on all the rewards is going to be an enormous job. As it stands now there are about 11,000 people we need to ship stuff to before the end of the year. (And my signature required just as many times!) The good news is, over the last couple years Cindy at What Pumpkin HQ down in Florida has worked on building quite an efficient and reliable shipping operation. The response to the Kickstarter was overwhelming, but we're in excellent shape to handle all the shipments before the holiday season. We just need to wait a couple more weeks for a few products to be finished, for Paypal orders to come in (and for me to sign 11,000 prints..........) and then we'll start pushing it all out.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOn the subject of the <a href=\"http://whatpumpkin.com/kickstarter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paypal option</a>, all the tiers are exactly the same, to stay consistent and be fair to everyone who already pledged. Though I guess one difference here is by Paypal's nature, you can put more than one of the packs in your cart, as opposed to only one with Kickstarter's tiered system. Also you may notice that some of the more coveted SNOUTPAKS are there, composed of some remaining unsold scalemates. Those supplies are still very limited, so again there's no telling how quickly they'll sell out.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd if you're wondering, even though the final count was $2.485MM, the $2.5MM stretch goal has been unlocked regardless. That means anyone who pledges for a physical copy of the game will also get a copy of Homestuck with it (as in, the story itself.) Once HS is done, we'll figure out a good way to create an offline version, in some convenient self contained format to be distributed with the physical game, and probably on its own as well.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI feel like there's a lot more to say, about the success of the Kickstarter and what it's meant, and what will follow in coming months. But there's plenty of time to address more later. Over the next few months, I'll fill you in on developments with the game here and there, as we start to make more specific plans for how to allocate the budget. There are exciting things ahead. For now though, I think this is the moment to reflect on what you've made possible. This really strikes me as a significant achievement by the readership. No great forces of marketing were involved to raise these funds, no promotion, no sponsorship, or any investments with weird strings attached. Just the energy of a passionate community of people who were excited enough about a project to make it happen. I think you have served as inspiration to any creative person who's wondering if they should bother pursuing their ideas. You've shown what is possible if they do. There are no gatekeepers anymore. There's only your support to be earned. And when it is, I don't think there's a more powerful force to have on your side.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOne last note: it does look like two people took the plunge for the $10,000 tier, and as such their fan trolls will be appear in canon (however fleetingly). Let us now pray for these two intrepid souls. \n"

This is Homestuck's final push. But before I start on it, I'll be taking a very significant hiatus to work on the <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game\" target=\"_blank\">game</a>.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n4/13/13 marked the 4th year of Homestuck, and a little more than the 5th year of MSPA's regular updates overall. Thanks to all those who've hung in there the whole time, as well as the very large number of you who piled on to this silly wagon at some point along the way. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe idea last year was to finish Homestuck and then begin working on the game. But as I've started to get into the early game dev process a bit, it's become obvious I have to start working on it much sooner. As in, right now. It takes many months of drawing and programming to make a game. But nobody can start on any of that until I've done a lot of writing and planning. So what it comes down to is, either I delay finishing Homestuck by a few months, or delay the release of the game by what would probably be a lot longer than that. Considering people threw 2.5 million bucks at me to make a game, I think that choice is obvious.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf I could do both at the same time, I would. But that's not realistic. Working on HS is an all consuming thing. Designing a whole game I believe will be too. It may sound obvious, but it can't be emphasized enough - entertainment takes a lot of time to create. More time than most people think. MSPA somewhat obscures that reality because I work on it as maniacally and efficiently as I can to keep the rate of output as high as possible. But the ease of production is an illusion. It is in fact a nonstop grind to generate this much material at a consistent rate. So I have to put all that on hold if I want to get anything else done.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI have noticed that some people believed HS would end on 4/13/13, though I never said that it would. Even if the story appeared to be on the precipice of resolution (which it wasn't), these rumors could be debunked for one simple reason. Animation takes A LOT of time. You've got to expect a story like this would end with some sort of big animation, right? I can't make those without suspending all updates completely for a good while. Trust me, the end to this won't sneak up on anyone. It will be really obvious when it's on the way.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nTo alleviate some of the suspense and wild speculation, I will give you a very loose estimate of my schedule, from now until the end of HS. Please observe these facts, as organized by this really awesome \"html table\" I have designed for this purpose.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<table style=\"background-color:#FFFFCC\">\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><b>The thing I am going to be doing</b></td>\n<td><b>How long that thing is going to take me</b></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Work on the game, and probably some other stuff, like make more HS books. Oh, also go to a few conventions. No updates.</td>\n<td>Months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Work on a whole bunch of regular updates for A6A6, leading up to the end of HS.</td>\n<td>Months</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Work on the final animation, plus zero or more other animations, just before or somewhat near the end of HS.</td>\n<td>Months</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo that's it for now. See you in a while. Unless you decide to reread Homestuck or something. In which case I guess I'll keep seeing you here. Well not me, but my website will see you. My website is always watching. \n"

When I get back I have to do a ton of boring stuff that has nothing to do with Homestuck, which will delay the pause beyond the convention. All the travel this year I am sure has resulted in hundreds of pages of lost progress. Yet this is how it must be. I must go see the people. I must draw thousands of <a href=\"/scraps2/johndoodle.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">5 second John doodles</a> for them. It is inescapable.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI expect to get back on a roll with updates some time in August. So mark that month on your calendar somehow.

When I'm done, I'll post it all at once. There are a lot of reasons why I think this is the best strategy.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nPrimarily, it's about efficiency, and being able to work on the remaining (and likely the most difficult parts) of the story without distractions, or the added challenge of having to crank out the next serial update as fast as possible, which means I always have to stay totally linear with the work. This way I can produce the rest of it more comprehensively, prepare animation assets in advance, do more stuff in parallel, etc. It will go faster. And ultimately, I think it'll read better as one thing, rather than as a sequence tortuously spread out over time, as has been the norm for years. I think it's close enough to the end now to safely retire Homestuck as a serial reading experience. There's nothing to be gained from that presentation anymore, in my view. It's just time to bear down and get it done.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI guess we're breaking for a long time on a big cliffhanger, but there's no way around that. Actually, pausing at any point later would probably be even worse, as it keeps pushing into endgame territory. That's why I'm stopping now instead of later. With such a big readership, the reactions will only get crazier, and the demand for new updates will get more intense. Over time, knowing so many people are slamming refresh many times per day starts to be more of an omnipresent distraction than anything. I think there is sort of a perception that I am creatively feeding off the hysteria surrounding the comic, but on a very practical level this is not true. Creating entertainment is not really a lifestyle of madcap shenanigans. It is a very sober, often dull process that requires a huge amount of time and concentration. It will be better to disarm the hype machine while I get the hard stuff done.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo what is the itinerary? Need to finish A663 through A666, and then A7. Keep in mind that these sub acts can be literally any length, even <a href=\"/mspa/006011\" target=\"_blank\">one</a> <a href=\"/mspa/007338\" target=\"_blank\">page</a>. There's a good bit of ground to cover, but most of the effort will be tied up in animation chores. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI don't really have a time estimate here, and am not sure there's any real advantage in coming up with one. It'll just be a while. I also have to allocate some time to work on the Kickstarter game. That didn't stop being a thing I have to do. It's coming along. I'll probably have a more substantive update on that before the end of the year. There hasn't been much to report yet since it's mostly been in a high level planning and writing phase. And firming up tons of legal minutiae. Stuff like that.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBut I will say there is something new to watch out for next month. Kind of a secret project I'm involved with, unrelated to MSPA or the KS game. Well, it's technically not that secret. It's only secret if you don't know about it yet. Meditate on those profound words, and keep an eye out for news on this in coming weeks.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOh yeah. Almost forgot, I'll have to take some time to port the site to a new server. Obviously it hasn't been cutting it the last couple months. So we'll work on that soon. Hopefully the new service will be able to handle the massive heart attack the next batch up updates will represent.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nDuring the gigapause, there should still be plenty to see here in the news section. Whether it's about the aforementioned projects, or new product releases, there'll be a lot going on. Trust me, the coolest stuff at What Pumpkin this season has yet to be released.\n"

What? You're confused? I can't imagine why. But ok, I'll start at the beginning.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nA while ago, <a href=\"http://shiftylook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ShiftyLook</a>, which is a Namco Bandai jam, asked me if I wanted to work on a project for them. It could be anything. I said that sounds cool. Except that I already had a lot to do, so maybe it wasn't realistic. But they said that's no problem. All I had to do was assemble an elite team of writers, artists, and programmers, and tell them what to do. If I pulled together a crack squad of loyal creatives, they would HAVE to do what I said, no matter how little sense it made. So I said that sounds good. I thought about it really hard, for three of the most intellectually excruciating seconds of my life. Then I said we should make a dating sim. I mean. <i>Obviously.</i>\n<br/><br/>\n\nThey said, are you sure that's a good idea? I said, hey who do you think is in charge here? They said they were. I said, oh, right. But it didn't matter. In the confusion, my pitch had somehow been approved due to a clerical error in Japan. Then I shouted suckers and fell backwards out of the airplane.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhile tumbling magnificently back to Earth, I pulled the vintage rolodex out of my horsehair fannypack, and began recruiting the best of the best. And so my team was convened. They were waiting for me below with the trampoline thing firefighters use. They watched as the Hussie stunt-mannequin gently descended, and then exploded with unexpected confetti. I then revealed that I had been waiting there with them for the last several hours, wearing a disguise, straddling my most famous horse. I introduced myself, and they graciously pretended they didn't know it was me all along. (I repeat. Best of the best.) I then clapped my hands and rubbed them together a lot and said, who's ready to make some NOISE in the dating sim genre? Who's ready to DO SOME DAMAGE? Nobody knew what to say to that, so I pressed on valiantly. I think I know what the people want, I said. What they WANT, is to be able to manipulate their favorite classic video game characters into a variety of lurid but safe-for-work romantic encounters. What they WANT, for instance, is to cajole a cute <a href=\"http://shiftylook.com/comics/katamari\" target=\"_blank\">Katamari</a> into some sort of kissing situation with the spaceship from <a href=\"http://shiftylook.com/comics/galaga\" target=\"_blank\">Galaga</a>. Are you ready to GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANT? They erupted into applause and began chanting my name, and they haven't stopped since.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nNamco High comes out probably some time next month.\n"

But if you really MUST deliver feedback to me personally, then I recommend the following ritual. Arrange a bunch of laptops in a circle, all pointing inward and running Namco High at the same time. Sit in the middle of the circle, and hold a flickering candle in each hand. Then whisper my name, picture a horse, and wet yourself gently. I believe you will find the results of this procedure to be spiritually profound, if also fake.\n"

Um, no, sorry. I still have no time estimate, or specific date I am shooting for. 4/13 would be the COOLEST date to shoot for, right? I doubt that's realistic though. Because in spite of my most religious wishes every single day, magic keeps on being fake. THANKS, \"god\".\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat is the status, then? The status is this. Since pausing, basically all I have been doing is writing. No drawing or animation yet. Writing, writing, writing. Writing for Homestuck, and writing for the adventure game. More time has been allocated to the latter. The game is a big, big project. Let's not kid ourselves here. It's like this whole new major story and everything, fueled by millions of dollars. That's a very different situation from Homestuck, which is usually fueled by approximately zero dollars. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nHomestuck probably needs another month of writing before I can start making panels. Not even to speak of Flash work. And of course, game development looms over everything as well. This feels totally different from the usual routine of write-draw-post, write-draw-post, write-draw-post, ad infinitum. Writing everything out beforehand is peculiar. And by peculiar I mean \"totally conventional\", in most other creative contexts. Let's see how that approach pans out. (You go out on a limb and guess it will result in the same silly bullshit as always.) \n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON?</b>\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Kickstarter</b> - Speaking of the game, I sent out a backer update just before the new<b><span style=\"font-family: Comic Sans MS;\">d</span></b> year. The same update just went out to paypal backers too (it took a while to set up a system for that). If you backed the project but didn't notice an update, you might want to check your email. If you didn't back it, sorry these updates are &lt;shhhh&gt;secret&lt;/shhhh&gt;. I mean, not really. The info gets \"leaked\" everywhere, if you know where to look. The point is, *I'M* technically not supposed to be the one tell you. Get it? Oh. You don't? Me neither.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOne question I feel like I should answer out in the open even though I kinda thought it was obvious (there is no such thing as obvious) since I see it come up so much: <u>yes, you will be able to purchase the game, even if you did not back the Kickstarter!</u>\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Contest</b> - In the near future, I'm going to be putting out some neat things through <a href=\"http://www.welovefine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">We Love Fine</a>. WLF is a cool company that makes a lot of nice stuff, that you will find particularly interesting if you are into \"the fandoms\". Do you like fandoms? When I was a kid we didn't even have those. All we had were shitty Atari games, and spankings.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBut before they formally launch any Homestuck stuff, they're running a <a href=\"http://contest.welovefine.com/contest/67-homestuck-design-contest#.UuS3aPQo6Q8\" target=\"_blank\">fun shirt design contest</a>. There are sweet cash prizes. Hey, only participate if you think is sounds fun though. Most people won't win, because that's what a contest is, according to the way that common word is classically defined. I ain't out to waste anyone's time! I do hope plenty of people submit designs though. There's some nutty stuff rolling in. People will laugh at me if I pick the naked Gamzee shirt. DON'T MAKE ME PICK THE NAKED GAMZEE SHIRT!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Another Secret Project</b> - Remember a while ago, I mysteriously mumbled something about a secret project? And then it came along, and it turned out to be Namco High? This is like that again. Except it's not a dating sim. Or a game, or anything like that. Also, it doesn't involve video game characters you've never heard of. It is a much more Homestuck-focused thing. That's all I'm gonna say! Ok, I lied, I will say one more thing: it's going to be really cool, and you will wonder where it has been all your life.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Vinyl Figures</b> - <a href=\"http://www.whatpumpkin.com/Toys/?show=all\" target=\"_blank\">These</a> are up in the store now! For actual sale. Hehe... look at em!\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.whatpumpkin.com/Toys/?show=all\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Vinyl Figures\" src=\"/archive/social/news/vinylfigures.jpg\" style=\"width: 420px; height: 261px;\"/></a>\n"

One that has launched on the 5th anniversary of Homestuck's first page. If the thirteenth of April holds a magical place in your heart, then chances are, you are on pins and needles waiting for me to post the end of the story. It will still be quite some time before that happens. I've had too much else going on to be able to attack the remaining content with the ferocity that has been characteristic of my update schedule over the years. It is nothing short of The Greatest Tragedy that a beloved story is held hostage to the ability of a single artist to continue creating it. Which brings us to the website called Paradox Space, and the chapter it will represent in Homestuck's extended life cycle.\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tAs I work on finishing the story, I tend to think a lot about where Homestuck as a creative property goes from here. It's hard to ignore the fact that it has turned into something much bigger than just a long, crazy story on the internet. It has a lot of fans, and there's a whole culture surrounding it. Friendships have been made, lives have been changed, or so people tell me. Those who like HS are extremely fond of the characters, yet those characters are trapped - \"stuck\" if you will - inside a very particular narrative, which itself has been at the mercy of my ability to produce it. So when I think about the future of Homestuck, I envision projects which liberate the things people love about it from the story itself, and most importantly, from my intensive personal effort.\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tSo this website is the first major step in that direction. Here is the idea:\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tParadox Space will feature many short comic stories involving literally any characters and settings from Homestuck. Any point in canon could be visited and elaborated on, whether it's backstory, some scenes that were skipped over or alluded to, funny hypothetical scenarios which have nothing to do with canon events, or exploring things that could have happened in canon through the \"doomed timeline\" mechanic that is a defining trait of Homestuck's multiverse-continuum known as \"paradox space\". There is a WHOLE LOT of fun stuff we can do here; and we will!\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tThe idea is also to get a lot of different artists and writers involved. It's going to be a major team effort. Occasionally I will write some comic scripts, particularly at the onset to help get this off the ground. But I'd like that to be the exception rather than the rule. I think it will be exciting to see how a talented pool of creators can work within the HS universe, and what they will bring to these characters. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see who's contributing so far. I guarantee that list of names will expand considerably in the months ahead.\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tAnd a quick shout-out to those I regard as the core contributors of Paradox Space. Rachel and Kory, who are the managing editors of the content. Tauhid, who designed this sick website. And Matt, who coded this sick website. These people worked very hard to get this site up and running. They did a great job.\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tParadox Space updates with a new page every weekday, starting this week. Next update is Tuesday, with the first page of another short story. What's it gonna be?? Believe me when I say these arcs can involve anything and anyone.\n\t<br/><br/>\n\tThe first story was drawn by Zack Morrison, who is a super solid comic maker. You should take a look at <a href=\"http://www.paranatural.net/\" target=\"_blank\">his webcomic</a> when you get the chance. It's really good! I'm not even \"just sayin\" that either. Why do ya think we asked him to make the first comic?? Dude's great. ;-]\n"

Am I finished HS yet? Um, nope. But I think enough is probably enough on the site's indefinite period of hibernation, so it's likely I will just start posting some stuff I have anyway, starting next month. Either mid or late October, let's say.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI said it would be a long pause, didn't I? Let's face it, a gigapause is just one big ass pause. It contains the smaller word \"giga\", which, in addition to literally meaning \"one billion\", you will find to be the root of the word \"gigantic\", which as we all know, means super huge. This intriguing fact reminds us that in our culture of words, we hold the number one billion as the indivisible quantum of general bigness, as a matter of principal. Food for thought! \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWe're coming up on almost a year since I paused. So that means I got like, SO much done on the story, right? Wow, no. Innumerable unspecified problems happened which badly prevented this from being true. I'd estimate out of those 12 months, I maybe squeezed in a grand total of 3 months worth of work on HS in there. Kinda dribbled across the year in the most frustrating way possible. So, I'm just gonna cry uncle on this dogshit pause and start posting stuff, but probably in a regimented way so I don't blow through everything I have too fast, thus giving me some time to work on the rest.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBack at the onset of the pause, I said I'd just post everything at once. (I was oversimplifying. I had always intended to stagger the final content to whatever extent, so as not to destroy the server.) But also that \"post everything at once\" idea was predicated on actually sorta... having it all done. Which as I have already culpa'd, is not the case. So I'm improvising at this point. I'll (probably) relaunch the story next month, come up with some kind of update schedule, and we'll see how it goes.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat have I been doing all year? Let's chalk it up to, in this order of relevance, a swirling multitude of Daunting Life Challenges, a flurry of accidental weird adventures causing me to thrash wildly across the nation, and the escalating complexities of running a business while tending to peripheral creative projects, not the least of which has been overseeing the development of an expensive video game. Actually, all things considered, I'm surprised at how much I actually HAVE gotten done this year. It just happens that \"making a ton of HS pages\" isn't one of those things.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat were the problems? What were the adventures? Sorry, nothing to see here. Me and the General Public just aren't that tight, and wild sob stories ain't my bag (unless they pertain to visits to the Olive Garden). Well, maybe I'll mention some things some day. But definitely nowhere in the proximity of a virtual stage adjacent to the sphere of rhetoric which could conceivably be construed as a series of excuses for why a mammoth load of free entertainment hasn't been finished yet. Did you follow that? Look over there. (When you look back at me, I am slowly rolling into a pile of trash.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe good news is, I'm still all about horses. Did you know that about me? It's true as shit. Horses; wow. Pretty good weird big animals? Or pretty GREAT weird big animals??\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat else should I say here. Oh. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWe've also been chipping away at upgrading the server over the last year. It's been surprisingly complicated and slow-going. Actually, prior to the pause, it was one of the most difficult things about updating, having an insufficient server that was GUARANTEED to crash every time I posted something. This was even after many, many upgrades over the years. It gets a little demoralizing trying to make tons of cartoons every day for a small nation of lunatics when the server constantly struggles to keep up with the ever-burgeoning readership, no matter how much I upgraded it. This was one of the (lots of) factors which contributed to me finally just saying, fuck it, time to pause.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nHopefully it can handle it now, but guess we'll see. It all runs on fancy clouds and such now. Which has been tricky to configure for such a complicated site utterly dependent on all the garbage ass-backwards code I've written over the years. Maybe... maybe once I start updating again, nobody will notice?? Man, wouldn't that be sweet. It will just be me and like a cozy little clique of 50 randos and 10 web bots, just like the old days. We'll bring this sucker home together, then hit up the local bargain Italian restaurant to celebrate. (Then a horse nuzzles me out of my sleepy dream fantasy, and the hammock flips over and dumps my screaming body on to the lawn.)\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFeels a little odd even TALKING about revving up this monstrosity again. It's been pretty serene on the web these days. I've been reluctant to even drop a pebble into the pristine glass-like state of the fandom, before being good and damn well ready to. Why wake the beast prematurely? We'll enjoy more than our share of blistering pandemonium when all is said and done. We are slowly building to a particular moment I foresee on the horizon. It's not just characterized by the end of the story, though that should be a factor. It's more than that. Things I have planned, and some other things we'll say may be fortuitously aligned. Invisible pieces of a heinous machine all snapping together, mechanically congealing with a grim sense of purpose. I'm tentatively branding to this moment as The Rapture, and it will be more than you can bear. More than anyone can. And everyone won't.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nHow has your year been?\n"

Especially because we may be in store for some spoooooky server crashes with these first few update dumps. Eep, I'm gettin the willies here! \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOne page today to test the waters (or uh, yesterday). When that's done and the coast is clear (it won't be), I'll post a bunch of pages on the 17th and 18th (oops, now the 18th and 19th). Then there will be nothing until 10/25. And then nothing until 11/1, at which point regular updates will begin again, according to an update schedule which I will share with you on that day. Then you will know which precise pattern of dates you will need to handcuff yourself to a computer and plug in your custom keyboard that only has a single giant F5 key.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIt would seem against my better judgment, or really my ability to control in any way whatsoever, a fair amount of hype has been brewing for the return of Homestuck. People are jacked up. They are doing little dances in places they cannot be seen. They are writhing in kiddie pools of pins and needles for the return of all their favorite fantasy children. \"John.\" \"Karkat.\" And more. So it's hard to avoid finding it just a LITTLE funny that after a year-long drought, hopping back in the saddle means we will have to wade through 50 pages of completely atrocious garbage before anything happens. It's funny how life works out sometimes. Funnier than a clown tickling a horse. Sometimes you pause your famous webcomic for a year, and then your grand reopening is a lot of bad anime. On such occasions, when life hands you those kooky lemons, there is really only one thing you can say.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFuck lemonade. These lemons are incredible.\n"

Caliborn's self insert guy is a nod to some <a href=\"http://nakkistiltz.deviantart.com/art/MSPA-AU-English-190066369\" target=\"_blank\">classic fan art from 4 years ago</a>, which to my memory was the first speculative drawing of LE before he was introduced. (Actually I guess two people made it? Didn't know, but thanks to both of them for the inspiration.) Also definitely wanna point out I'm not making fun of that art, which I think is a good drawing. I do remember once upon a time thinking it was pretty funny to imagine LE as a cool anime guy though. So maybe that idea stuck with me all these years and led to the inspiration for this ridiculous arc? Who knows how inspiration really works. Anyway it's all in good fun, and I still sometimes try to do the \"reader input influencing story outcomes\" in little ways like this to keep that part of MSPA alive, even long after the fanbase got too big to do it directly through commands.\n"

So if you read a joke and go, pff, that was SO last year, that's why. But really, the joke is on you, because cracking wise about DeviantArt weeaboo culture I believe was en vogue in 2007, so in summary, eat it nerds. Actually it's amazing how DA still seems to be running about as strong as ever on that front.

I think Cascade was the last one? Kind of a throwback to the old Art Team days. Remember that? Actually, the expanded network of PXS artists is almost like Homestuck Art Team 2.0. A number of the (now many) artists involved with that comic have sorta parlayed that work into other HS projects, including stuff for the game (more on that soon). It's been pretty awesome having so many great artists help build on the Homestuck universe.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAbout the Flash. Or really, A663 as a whole. Truly we are back in the saddle, with bad anime and mass murder - the quintessential Homestuck Experience. A year ago I knew I was going to have to pause for a long time. I made sure to cut it off just before this act, not after. Leaving you hanging on that note for a year... damn. Not even I am that cruel. Now you will only have to wait a week to see what happens next. I will say this much. It sure is a bunch of stuff that happens. The regular update engine lurches back to life on 11/1. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBut as of typing this, by my watch, 10/25 isn't over yet, and technically neither is the update day. Hmm.\n"

Cal's inspiring journey as an artist is nearly complete. His \"masterpiece\", A6A6A5, is really going to be... wow. Something else, let me tell you. I will also disclaim it will be uncharacteristically plot relevant for these goofy green-web-skinned bookends to the greater A6A6 arc. Oops I have said to much already. Sorry, his masterpiece is just really really exciting stuff, even by Homestuck standards. Hopefully the Felt pony up the calcoins BIG TIME.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI briefly considered making calcoins a real thing in tandem with this update. I asked somebody how bitcoins worked, and the absolute worst case scenario happened. Bitcoins were explained to me. So obviously I axed that idea. But maybe there's still hope? Maybe intrepid fans can make calcoins real. Who's in charge of making all the bitcoins out there? Is that Reddit? I think it might be Reddit. Somebody please get in touch with the head honchos of Reddit and get to work on the calcoins, stat. Bonus points if they can somehow have negative monetary value.

      "html": "\n<div class=\"date link\"><a class=\"11-08-14\" href=\"/news/11-08-14\">8 November 2014</a></div>\nThere comes a time in every young Homestuck's life when they must face the fact that a notable comic author has swindled them into getting on a bus labeled \"cool updates\", only to swerve said bus off the highway and into a precipitous gulch of unmitigated sadstuck. But the old wives tale says that sadstuck was just a thing that happened in our fanfics, the bus children wailed. That's what they said about the tricksters too, a veteran child in the back replied. They said the tricksters would never see the light of canon, but where are the doubters now? Where are they now. Propping up six feet of dirt is where. The veteran child is weirding everybody out, so they stop looking at him, and turn to the driver. But the driver is now a spooky skeleton and the kids lose their shit. The skeleton head does a creepy 180, and speaks his scary curse. Heed me bus youths, for I am the ghost of future sadstuck. I have traveled back in time and am on a bus for some reason I guess, to punish you for your maudlin fics. For every time you murmured sadstuck while having a feeling, for every fic you pastebinned by candlelight, my curse has grown stronger, and my legend, dumber. Then the skeleton ran out of stuff to say, and looking a little embarrassed, turned around again to keep driving. Then he screamed once he remembered the bus was falling.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThanks for listening to my short story. We like to have a good time here at MS Paint Adventures, The Website. The gigaplay is off to a rocky start of unhewn feels. If your kerchief has become too soggy with tears from emotion, skeleton terror, or just plain admiration for my skill as a short story writer (can't blame you there), and you wish to lighten the mood, I recommend moseying over to <a href=\"/pxs/the-inaugural-death-of-mister-seven\" target=\"_blank\">Paradox Space</a>, which is currently running a 24 page comic I have written about Crowbar. I am alert to the desires of readers every single day, and the one thing I hear them clamor for above all else, is more stories about CROWBAR. We want more content about Crowbar, RIGHT NOW, they say, and make that content consist of 24 beautifully illustrated comic pages, MINIMUM. I just give the people what they want.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFortunately, Homestuck's Premier Felt Fan #1 <a href=\"http://helvetica.jnwiedle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jones</a> was available to do a spectacular job of illustrating this comic. My rambling noir-style monologues have never before overlapped such lovely artwork. \n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>GOD TIER TALK!</b>\n<br/><br/>\n\nI don't answer Q's about Homestuck much anymore. It was a practice which I think used to be some people's lifeline for decoding the enigmatic runes of this story. Now, since they can no longer depend on answers which I supply between horse jokes and snappy retorts, they are lost in the woods to fend for themselves against the wolves of dubious fanalysis. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nPulling the ripcord on the Homestuck machine again, combined with recent story events, makes me think something FAQQY may be in order. The thing is, when you make a big story, and allude to rules for a complicated system dictating mortality, people tend to REALLY, REALLY want to understand how it works. Speculation naturally fills the vacuum in lieu of concrete data. Theories are crafted. Headcanons, congealed. Then, when additional data is presented (DEAD KIDS), which happen to chafe with fanon constructs, feelings run ragged, and Bullshit is called. Then Bullshit shows up, and says, you rang? And the fanonistas say, yes Bullshit. Look at this mess. LOOK at it. This in NO WAY jives with my views on what constitutes heroism and justice. Bullshit nods sagely while lighting its pipe.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nEarlier in HS when god tier folk were more scarce, the story was more cagey about these verdicts. The Vriska ruling was presented as a close call, which maybe could have gone either way. Then Slick smacked the clock to Just before it could settle, leaving the true verdict ambiguous, and the 'moral debate' intact, so to speak. But now that there are a lot of god tiers running around, with the stakes raised and the body count piling up, the game (or, story) is starting to be more liberal with its rulings. As in, more likely to come down hard on Just, Heroic, or Neither verdicts without intervention or obfuscation, helping us better understand the boundaries of heroic and just action through example. Not necessarily by moral definitions, but as dictated by the rules of a game. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo that turns the story guy (sometimes known as an \"author\") into something like a ref at a basketball game. He blows the whistle when he sees the <a href=\"/mspa/005549\" target=\"_blank\">basketball guy</a> (the \"baller\") take a half step without bouncing the ball. The home team crowd does not detect the subtle violation and goes boooooo! Those homers can boo all they want, but you know, the guy is really just some <a href=\"/mspa/005548\" target=\"_blank\">bozo with a whistle</a>. The rules are the rules!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere's reason to think there is a nuanced scale ranging from Heroic to Just inside the clock. There may be many shades of justice and heroism, some forms just barely qualifying to seal one's fate. But there's nothing nuanced about Alive vs. Dead. The result of a coin flip is absolute, even though there may be many subtle factors contributing to which side it lands on. Such as whether the coin is pure of heart, and whether the table it lands on has ever killed a man. You get a sense for the nuance of the judgment when it comes to these \"close calls\", like with Vriska, or more recently, with Jade. In her case, she was subject to mind control when she racked up her misdeeds, which ordinarily would probably exempt her. But it wasn't ordinary mind control. More like flipping an \"evil switch\", removing her ethical filter, thereby letting he personality come through, and giving her license to act on impulses which she'd ordinarily suppress. So this gives the clock something to work with. Still, her behavior is compromised, so it's by no means a slam dunk. (BASKET BALL! that is still the metaphor.) So it's very close, and perhaps the clock even spares her... except for Aranea, whose luck lets close calls break in her favor, and nudges that needle one hair to the Just side. Very unlikely that happens if it's not close already though. Jane's situation is basically the same, and so is her verdict.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nHow about Jake? He's the only player who's had two rulings. The first time, he was blustering Ronald Reagan quotes at the top of his lungs when Jane forked him, which I think we may agree safely disqualifies him from heroism (though the Republican party may disagree). The second time was ruled Heroic, when he took a realmaginary ninja sword through the chest for a friend. This corresponds pretty closely with most people's definition of heroic, so I doubt anyone would consider this one controversial either. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nDave? Probably not much to debate here either. Fighting while attempting to save a dead friend, to bring her back to Jane for resurrection. There's a moral element here, tied to common ideas of heroism, so there's not much in dispute. When factors stray somewhat from moral notions of heroism, that's when there is more fuel for debate. So what about Rose?\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Wasn't John killed by Jack under similar circumstances to how Rose died? So why did he survive, and Rose didn't?</b>\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe circumstances were very similar, on the surface. But I would suggest that the similarity of the two situations, both leading to different outcomes, helps clarify the rules in play, not confuse them. The reason for this? SCIENCE.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf you were a scientist in this fictional world, trying to test this fictional construct, these are the exact kinds of situations you would seek out to prove or disprove whatever hypothesis you had. Situations that are very similar, with most factors isolated, and varying only in minor and controlled ways. That's how you would start to understand where the line is between heroic and non-heroic conduct.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo what varies between the situations? What line does Rose cross which John doesn't? It becomes pretty obvious if you break the two scenes down. John was standing there, poised for battle with Jack, for all of two seconds before Jack auto-stabbed him from behind. Not even to speak of the underhanded tactic by the villain, I think what's more important is John didn't even get a chance to move. Or specifically, to prove through action that he was prepared to do battle with a foe. In fact, hindsight may tell us he wasn't. He hadn't been through much then. But years later, when he reenacted that scene with Jack through a dream bubble, he was ready that time. He had years to think about that moment, to reflect on the damage caused by Jack, and what he might have done differently if he'd been more prepared, and if the battle wasn't cut short. But during the first encounter, there was no time for heroic intent to translate into action.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nCompare with Rose's situation. Her feelings are unambiguous. Her mind is made up, and committed to action in the form of forward motion. Sorry Rose, you took a few too many steps through the paint on your drive to the hoop. Gotta blow the whistle!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe two similar situations illustrate where one of the lines are for heroism (as a game rule, not moralistically), and in this case, that line is action. It would seem it's not good enough just to have heroic intentions or bold feelings. It doesn't cut it to strike a pose and look cool for two seconds. The intent should be expressed through commitment to an action. The action is what proves the intent. For all we know, John wasn't ready to back up his posture. For all we know, he was terrified! Rose wasn't though. Her action proved it.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>Why does Rose lashing out in vengeance count as heroic?</b>\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf you wanted my personal opinion on heroism, I would say a vengeful act is not heroic by itself. We all have our ideas on what heroism means. But I think this is the wrong question to ask.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe concern here is less about the moral definition of a heroic act, and more about how heroism is defined in terms of a series of rules which a game system can enforce.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBased on some evidence we have, and some things Doc once said about god tier immortality, it's pretty safe to make at least one generalization about heroism as a game construct. The game/story regards your behavior as Heroic if you make some effort to defeat or kill someone who is villainous (or in other words, someone worthy of a Just death). The state of the hero's mind is just an additional consideration, such as whether they happen to be motivated by anger or vengeance.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nBut let's imagine for a moment that a vengeful act is automatically unworthy of heroism, even if directed against a great evil. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWouldn't this be a MAJOR loophole for god tiers to avoid dying heroic deaths? It would mean to qualify as a hero, you couldn't feel anger toward a villain who has almost certainly done something to provoke anger. If a hero ever experienced loss at the hands of a villain, their natural emotional state would exempt them from the heroic consequence of the actions resulting from that anger. They would be completely invulnerable to a villain, so long as they maintained a grudge! The thing with villains is, they tend to have a way of inflicting loss on others. If being wronged precluded heroic behavior, villains would suddenly discover heroes to be incredibly rare commodities.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere's a lot to think about here. It's a combination of how you want to morally define heroism and justice, and how to pragmatically construct enforceable rules to that effect. The latter is something that can get very technical, and boil down to hairline actions such as whether one exhibits clear enough forward motion or such, roughly the way sports are officiated. There's no way I'll ever come up with a full list of rules, or even get much deeper into the rules than I have here. But I believe this is a rational outline for the way the subject may be examined, if you wish to do so!!!\n"

The song features some hella piping, a lot more than what you heard in the Flash. Animating five full minutes of pipe organ music maybe, just maybe, would have been a tall order. I guess there could always have been a few more slow panning shots across breezy landscapes. Keep an eye out for that version of the Flash in the director's cut of Homestuck, which of course will be ten times longer.\n"

This means A6A6I4 is going to end a little sooner than previously advertised. Same total page count, but finishing sooner. Please consult the important horse calendar below.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"Updated Calendar\" src=\"/archive/social/news/cal_jan15_updated.gif\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo what happens when A6A6I4 is done? I'm not quite sure yet. I'm still working on everything that comes after that. I've written it mostly, but haven't drawn anything yet. There will almost certainly be another pause, but I'm not sure how long it will be yet. I will let you know after 1/19.\n"

      "html": "\n<div class=\"date link\"><a class=\"1-19-15\" href=\"/news/1-19-15\">19 January 2015</a></div>\nSo what do we call this pause? I've been batting ideas around all day. We could go with the obvious choice, the MINIGIGAPAUSE. Or maybe, MEGAPAUSE 2: BACK IN THE MEGASADDLE. Or if that makes too much sense, we could always settle on the MICROTERAPAUSE. As you can see, there are so many incredibly intelligent and meaningful things we could call this pause. Deciding how to refer to the pause is an exercise that I will leave to the reader. Feel free to discuss the matter with friends. Or strangers. Anyone who will listen really. If they start to run away, I strongly recommend you chase them.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhy don't we say that A665 begins on <b>4/13</b>. That's a fun number that we all can get excited about. I have a lot of catch-up work to do between now and then. Not the least of which is drawing the actual content to be posted. But also a lot of gamedev work. Game production is rolling pretty hot right now. Stuff is being churned out almost faster than I can keep track of. Did I mention? I accidentally started running a game studio a little while ago. Whoops, sorry about that. There are all these people being paid to make things happen, and I have to be like \"Yeah, keep doing that stuff, everybody.\" It's getting pretty easy to lose track of how many people work for What Pumpkin. My last estimate was somewhere between 30 and 1000. The true figure is a very frisky moving target.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nA6A6A5, a.k.a. Caliborn's Masterpiece, is actually done. It's probably better to hold off posting it until 4/13, when more content will soon follow afterwords. I am sure pausing on that note for months would mess with your head a lot more than the note we're already pausing on. I sometimes feel I have at least a modest responsibility to manage your sanity. It'll be tough sitting on this content though. Tougher than sitting on all of A664 for the better part of a year. I don't think it is out of line to describe it as the best material this website will ever exhibit. It will be all down hill from there, in every direction. Even up.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSpeaking of sanity management, way back when, I was pretty on the fence about posting A664 spaced out over months like I did, vs. all at once. Doing the latter in hindsight probably would have been a fucked up thing to do to the internet though. The GAME OVER fallout alone was a bit much as it was. Including it in tandem with the rest of it? Not sure what to make of that. Let's review the CONTENT CRUSH that would have entailed. Bad Anime -&gt; Game Over -&gt; Sadstuck -&gt; Lowas Quest -&gt; 100 retconned panels of oil -&gt; A bunch of other shit -&gt; Punky Serket -&gt; Fantroll Storytime -&gt; 8 password pages -&gt; The Kiss On Horse Mountain -&gt; and finally -&gt; The Punchline. You know, that's an awful lot of baloney to publish. I think the fell-swoop reaction to all that would have been quite a thing to behold, but also, perhaps an irresponsible thing to do to a hapless fanbase after a year in hibernation. I'm told that in 2015, young people are heavily susceptible to \"the feels\", and trifling with those forces could be injurious to their future development. Wait, did that just sound like something your grandpa would say? Mother fuck, where did I put my cane. Oh right, I snapped it in half from shaking it at the sky. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI may have been in the process of making a point there, but we're going to have to pick this up another time. The comic isn't going to pause itself!!!\n"

That's in just a few days. Are you ready? I doubt it, but when has that ever stopped us before. We start with Caliborn's much anticipated masterpiece, running from the 13th-15th. Then regular updates probably resuming a week after that. I haven't decided on the update schedule yet, but when I do it will almost certainly be communicated to you in the only manner which you will tolerate from me, which is more horse calendars. I am thinking of a fairly swift update schedule. A lot has piled up. Over the last month (not counting his 40 page masterpiece, which was done months ago) I have somehow drawn another 400 pages, which is possibly some sort of MSPA record. Be warned, due to that obscene page rate some of these panels are lookin pretty fast and loose! They nevertheless exist, which is usually what matters most for this website. There's still more to draw beyond that to finish off the rest of A6A6I5, which is the final \"normal act\". But really not too much. We're getting real close here. I will chip away at the remaining panels as I roll out this batch. Then, it's all animation work after that.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n3) <a href=\"/pxs\" target=\"_blank\">Paradox Space</a>! 4/13 is the exact one year anniversary of its launch. And as HS resumes, PXS will be pausing for a good while. We actually paused production back in January, and have just been posting from a comic buffer since. This has much to do with shifting priorities heavily to gamedev needs, but I'll explain more about it and the future of PXS in a little while, on that site. But also, there'll be a PXS book coming out soon! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pxscomics/status/585199014221651970\" target=\"_blank\">It looks very good</a>. Also, if you haven't checked out PXS in a while, now would be a great time, because it's going into its pause on a very strong note. It's been running an incredibly great 51 page story by <a href=\"http://www.paranatural.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Zack</a>, <a href=\"http://www.beyondthecanopy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jon</a>, and <a href=\"http://shelbycragg.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Shelby</a>.

I have taken quite an extensive tour through your offerings and I have yet to find an unattractive face in front of Arquiusprite's tremendous buttocks. Kudos to every single selfie-snapper for being so preposterously photogenic. Just, wow.

Meaning there are two left, one on monday and tuesday. This doesn't mean you're seeing all that will happen before the endstuff. After the pause there'll be another stetch of pages more in the vein of escalating material, which I think is better to post closer to the animation that follows it, rather than now and get everybody hype for a whole lot of waiting. Instead I picked an update to pause it on which I think is a good and nice place to leave off that doesn't feel too cliffhangery. Then there'll be a significant pause, but only because I still haven't quite figured out how to pull a very significant animation project out of thin air yet. So that'll take a good while. I guess I'll say more about the pause when it has officially begun. Until then please enjoy the weekend of the Great Hug Bump of 2015. \n"

Sorry about that! But then again, pause announcements aren't very exciting, and I already told you there would be a pause, so it PROBABLY doesn't matter much? Anyway, here it is. The Omegapause Announcement. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf you go by page count, Homestuck is about 99% done. The remaining 1% will involve another stretch of pages, and some heavy animation work, which I probably won't even start for another month or two, as I catch up with some <a href=\"http://hiveswap.com/\" target=\"_blank\">other work</a>. In case it hasn't seemed obvious by now, I'm not in much of a hurry anymore. The manic rates of production this site used to enjoy will not be revisited. I won't be making 13+ minute animations in six weeks anymore. (That is very fast, if you didn't know.) All remaining content will be created at a pace more in keeping with the spirit of sanity. It will be done when it's done.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAs for when that is, I don't have any concrete projections. Maybe it will all drop some time next year? Hmm, seven acts in seven years... sounds pretty good to me! Maybe it will work out that way. I guess we will have to wait and see. I think it will be good though. If it was going to be bad, you'd be watching it tomorrow.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIn other news, the entries for the <a href=\"http://community.welovefine.com/m/contests/designs/Homestuck-Design-Contest-2\" target=\"_blank\">We Love Fine Shirt Design Contest</a> are in, and ready for votes. There are a bunch of good ones! Thanks to all who submitted a design.\n"

Hasn't been much to see here in a while, so I figured it was time to stop by. Actually I was planning on giving a more substantive update on the progress with both Homestuck and Hiveswap around the end of the year. I'm working on both at the same time right now, so it's keeping me very busy. But progress is going well for both. I'll probably be in a better position to say when Homestuck will update by the end of the year. I'll also have a better collection of materials to show for a Hiveswap update by then too. Progress on the game has been looking great. I've just been very focused on getting work done, so I haven't really had much time to organize a meaningful update. Check back in a few weeks though, and there should be something to see. Thanks for the patience!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIn the meantime, neat things keep popping up in the We Love Fine store.

Must be a miracle. My apologies for having wasted your Christmas miracle on something so pedestrian as new web content. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnyway, about that content. Got a couple STATUS UPDATES to report.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nFirst, <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/14293468/homestuck-adventure-game/posts/1453119\" target=\"_blank\">here's an update on Hiveswap</a>. Long story short: there was a bit of a pause while we shifted gears on the production, but all the new stuff is looking fantastic. Take a look and see for yourself! You will not disagree.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSecond, Homestuck. Remember that? Me neither. Um, ha ha, just kidding, it's all I think about ever. Anyway, I've been juggling work between this and Hiveswap pretty furiously. But I've been making progress on the ending. I would like to shoot for 4/13 of next year to have it wrapped up. Given everything I have to do, this might actually be a tight squeeze! But I'll do my best. It will conclude with Act 7, and some preceding material including EOA6 will lead up to it. It's a lot of content. I'm getting uncomfortably close to reaching a half hour of projected new animation footage. (No, not all in one animation, don't worry. Spread out across several.) Will it all be ready in time for the 7 year anniversary of Homestuck? We'll just have to wait and see.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI'll give you another update on the status before then though. Why don't we say... another month? Sounds good to me, see you then.\n"

If the question is whether I'm still on track for a 4/13 finish, the answer I think is \"probably\". The remaining content is a scattered array of regular panels and animated content, but I think I can boil it down to the two heaviest individual \"projects\" which comprise most of the effort needed to finish. Those are End of Act 6, and Act 7. So to give you a better sense of where I am, I will track the progress of those two things as a percentage of completion.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nEOA6 - 30%\n<br/>\nA7 - 100%\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI will update these numbers in another month. Hopefully they will both be higher, instead of lower.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>SHOUT OUT ZONE BELOW</b>\n<br/><br/>\n\nWelcome to the shout out zone, here are a couple of shout outs. The first shout out is,\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.neo-kosmos.com/\" target=\"_blank\">NEO-KOSMOS</a>: A comic by my friend Shelby (who did all Calliope art for HS), and her friends Amber (works on Steven Universe) and Adrienne (also does a lot for HS). They've been working really nicely with the MSPA format. It's a quick read to catch up, and it really feels like the story has been taking off lately. I'd recommend you at least read up to a very cool animation they just posted (which includes a song by Toby). If you're looking for a fun story to follow over the next few months while you wait for HS, I think this is a good pick!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe next shout out is <a href=\"http://undertale.com/\" target=\"_blank\">UNDERTALE</a>, by my friend Toby. I know I mentioned it on the KS update but it probably bears repeating here too. Also I guess it's not so much a \"signal boost\" since by now UT is PRETTY WELL KNOWN! Let's get real, Toby is probably the one who should be giving HS shout outs from now on. Though it's not about giving UT a boost in popularity so much as a reminder that I believe he has made a fun and special game, and if you haven't gotten around to playing it yet, I think you should! It's an experience that anyone who likes games should have.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nOk, see you in another month. Bye.\n"

The panels they did are very good, and I think make for a nice runway leading up to the final animations. Of course there are a lot of other great contributing artists to all that content as well.

It's available here on <a href=\"/music/album/act-7\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp</a>. It was originally featured in Clark's album, <a href=\"/music/album/symphony-impossible-to-play\" target=\"_blank\">Symphony Impossible to Play</a>. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nToday marks exactly seven years from the day Homestuck began. And Act 7's single-page installment marks the end of the story. Seven acts in seven years, to finish a sprawling \"creation myth about kids in houses,\" as I would describe it for those who asked what my next project was about before I started it. What is there to say about this ending? The short and funny answer is, Homestuck has finally completed its long journey over the rainbow, and become the anime it was always meant to be. The longer and less funny answer will need some reflection. Maybe some day I will say some things about it. For now, I will leave you to draw your own conclusions.  \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe animation itself had a fairly complicated production history. I actually storyboarded it about four years ago. In fact, some of the shots I visualized before I even began Homestuck. I'd like to extend very special thanks to <a href=\"http://guzusuru.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Angela Sham</a>, who took the reins on the animation while it was in progress, and worked with me closely on it for about a year until it was done. She's a great animator, and I'm quite excited that she's continuing to work with us on the game. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIt probably goes without saying, but ending this story is a personally significant moment as well. I could say more about this too, but I'd rather not fill the news section with too many words today. For now, all that's left to do is express some appreciation. Whether you've been here from the beginning, hopped on board somewhere along the way, or only heard of it last week and made an insane dash through the archive to catch up in time for the conclusion, I mean this sincerely:\n\n<br/><br/>\n<img src=\"/archive/social/news/thanksforplaying.jpg\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n\nEdit: one more thing. If you're curious about whether there will be anything resembling an epilogue to this ending, yes, I've been thinking about that for some time. It'll take a while to produce though, whatever specific form it ends up taking. Working on Collide took months, and came right down to the wire. I've got more time now though obviously. But that said, I'm not in a huge hurry at this point. Keep an eye out here for developments. There should be plenty of other news in coming months too. \n"

Whew, that is a nice looking game! Not going to lie, I am on some big time tenterhooks in anticipation of this release. I've actually started doing stunts on the tenterhooks, flipping around on them wildly, like a gymnast. It's an astounding spectacle of physical endurance and might. Sorry you can't check this out, it's absolutely unreal. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat else have I been up to? I sense that this has been being wondered about. Some I suspect wonder about the epilogue I mentioned, which I have been making some notes on here and there. But otherwise have been deferring in favor of attention to ~other projects~ which strike me as more pressing. It will be gotten around to. If you are wondering which of these projects may be related to Homestuck, I did have some \"post-canon content\" planned for later this month. That is as specific as I can be for now. Tune in here, let's say, a couple weeks from now.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe project that has occupied the lion's share of my professional time is one that you will understand completely why I have prioritized, when you eventually see it. Arguably it will prove to be the only relevant work of art in human history. I don't wish to give anything else away, or delay your experience of this unprecedented triumph of the human spirit. So instead I will <a href=\"/images/bluejeff.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">light a fire under my ass</a>, and attempt to deliver the <a href=\"/images/goodshit.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">content</a> I know you have all been craving.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nWhat else to report? Hmm. I know that usually the passage of time for creative individuals is tracked by the hours they spend which ultimately contribute to creative products which may be consumed. It is far from true that all of my hours this year have been applied that way. Suffice to say I've been on some strange adventures. I doubt I can do any of them justice here, in a newspost which is rapidly running out of words I'm willing to type. At one point I was thrown out of a stable. I've probably said too much already.

Everyone involved has much to be proud of. Personally, I think the game is VERY GOOD! Really, better than I imagined it would be when scribbling notes for it years ago. Credit is owed to the fans for their patience while the necessary time was taken to build a studio capable of making a game like this. And above all, credit is owed to the great team that brought it to life. If you happen to spot any contributors out in the wild, on social media or such, I hope you will extend your appreciation for what they have accomplished.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<b>ANNOUNCEMENT TWO</b>\n<br/>\n\nWhat Pumpkin and Homestuck are partnering with <a href=\"https://www.viz.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Viz Media</a> to work on a lot of cool stuff together in the future. This will include projects based on both the Homestuck and Hiveswap worlds. The possibilities are wide open, but here are a couple examples of things we know we're going to work on already...\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nViz will begin releasing the Homestuck books again, starting next year. These will be nice new hardcover editions, and the plan is to just keep turning out volumes until the entire story is in print. Each volume will be full of my Secret Notes just like the previous ones were. Viz will also be involved in the release of the mysterious epilogue project I alluded to a while ago. Details on format, release date, etc, will remain undisclosed until further notice, but you can expect more information about that to surface next year too. I wanted to do something a little unusual for it, something existing outside the confines of the web story. Working with Viz struck me as good opportunity for this.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAside from that, anything can happen. Take a look at the sorts of things Viz has already published or produced. These are all examples of things on the table for future consideration for either Homestuck or Hiveswap. I've got plenty of ideas, and so do they. Maybe you do too?? \n"

This seemed like a good way to do it since we had no idea how many of these books to print. A hundred? A million? ZERO??? You guys will decide. Plus there's a lot of other cool stuff there. If you have any interest in this book at all, it's probably a good idea for you to jump on it now. There's no telling how easy it will be to get your hands on after the first run has shipped to backers.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1724736026/sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff-by-hussie-dril-and-kc-gre\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/archive/social/news/sbahj_ks_graphic.jpg\"/></a>\n<br/><br/>\n\nAbout the friends who helped out: my guess is you are probably familiar with dril's twitter brand? A couple years ago we talked about working on this, one thing led to another, and now here we are asking you to buy a book with a spoon concealed inside of it. The way I see it is, you don't just get any clown off the street to write for characters with the complexity and emotional depth that these ones have. You bring out the big guns. This is a man who knows his way around a huge ass. A man who knows all too well the plight of the gamer. A man who won't hesitate to engage with some of your favorite brands, and will not flinch at a longform narrative about a pissed off guy searching the world for his spoon. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nKC Green has already done some good work with the SBaHJ franchise, you may remember. For the sake of authenticity I did a lot of coloring work over his pencils and put some serious attention on generally screwing everything up. Don't worry, we had some very important standards of quality that I took great care to ensure we catastrophically failed to meet. KC does a lot of other great stuff too. Did you know he did the dog who says this is fine even though the room is on fire? It's crazy how much people love that damn dog. Not everyone knows he did it though, and people should applaud him more for his stuff. Same with dril. Let's hear it for these boys and their priceless contributions to our society. I hope you like this book!\n\n<br/><br/>\n"

A \"bomb shell\", you could say. The zodiac has officially been extended to include 288 signs, instead of the meager assortment of 12 you are familiar with. The resulting system is known as the <a href=\"http://hs.hiveswap.com/ezodiac/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">Extended Zodiac</a>. You may determine your True Sign by taking a test, if you wish.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI envisioned an expansion like this a couple years ago, when it became clear that due to the large volume of NPCs in Hiveswap, many new troll symbols would have to be created. So we made a large library of symbols to draw from when designing characters (A lot more symbols than characters. Don't worry, the game roster isn't THAT out of control.) But why stop at just a static library of new signs when you could take the opportunity to reinvent astrology itself?\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe test uses a couple other personal classifiers from Homestuck lore to triangulate your True Sign designation from this dizzying barrage of iconography. What do you do with this information? I don't know. Make some cool new OCs? Discuss your new sign with friends? Cause great agitation and bewilderment among astrological purists? The sky's the limit. Also, those invested in what qualifies as \"canon\" when it comes to Homestuck lore may take interest in this test, which formally evaluates whether you are a Prospit or Derse Dreamer (involving a new term of art for the sake of this system, called Lunar Sway), as well as your Aspect. I am sure some will wonder whether this means a God Tier Class test will be available as well. Some day, yes, probably. For now, only Aspect is applicable to this system. But the precedent now exists for the expectation to be CANONICALLY classified by literally any absurd profiling system I have ever concocted, and you have just obtained a full license to not let anyone forget this. \n\n<br/><br/>\n"

This has been done by converting Flash files into either an HTML-based format, or converting to a video file. Many of the video files are only temporary, and will be replaced in coming months, either with HTML-converted files, or higher quality videos. This entire site is still a work in progress. Homestuck is a huge story, with many different presentations and uses of media. Adapting such a work to a new, more broadly compatible format is a very big job. The VIZ team has done great work in adjusting to all the challenges so far. Please be patient as the conversion process continues.\n          </p><p class=\"line-caption\">\nOver the last several years, I've noticed many wondering if Homestuck would ever compensate for the obsolescence of Flash, and its gradual inability to be viewed by browsers and mobile devices in coming years. Yes, I had been thinking about that, but as I said above, making those adjustments was always going to be an enormous undertaking. So VIZ has been doing a major favor to the story, and fandom in general, by taking this on. \n          </p><p class=\"line-caption\">\nMore broadly than just converting Flash pages, this adaptation serves another purpose. My intent for MSPA was never to have it last forever, or to concern myself with maintaining a labyrinthine, crudely-coded website for the rest of my life. At some point, the right thing to do was always going to be figuring out how the stories hosted on it could persist long into the future. VIZ Media is about as good as any organization I can think of when it comes to publishing long-running series, and preserving them for future readers. They print many classic manga series and get those books on shelves all over the world, thus keeping those series alive and widely read, well beyond their initial publication. So the VIZ team and I are working together to preserve the original content while updating its delivery, but Homestuck's unusual format makes this a unique challenge. (Incidentally, they'll also be releasing the full run of <a href=\"https://www.viz.com/read/graphic-novel/product/homestuck/13126?utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_source=Homestuck.com&amp;utm_campaign=Homestuck_Home_Book_1\" target=\"_blank\">Homestuck in print</a> as well, to complement the work online.)\n          </p><p class=\"line-caption\">\nMy hope is you will see these changes as a net-positive, and perhaps can enjoy the work again in ways that weren't possible before (such as on your phone). Again, this adaptation will continue to evolve and improve. Any feedback you may have when it comes to the performance or presentation, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:tech-support@homestuck.com\">contact</a> the site team at VIZ. They're taking everyone's remarks seriously. Thanks again to all who continue to care enough about Homestuck to stop by and read this. We all appreciate your support.\n          </p>\n"

I ditched the old shoutbox in lieu of a simple <a href=\"/blogspot/ms-paint-adventures-suggestion-box\">comment feature following a blog post</a>. Shoutboxes are always breaking. This seems like a much more stable solution. Plus I <i>suppose</i> I can use that blog for various things if I need to. Such as blogging, for example, should my temperament reach such a critical spike in desperation.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSECOND. You may have noticed I have decided to align myself with <a href=\"http://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id=29996&amp;type=2\">Project Wonderful</a>. It seems to me like an elegant way to handle the ad thing, which has appeared increasingly necessary cause hostin' sure is goddarn 'spensive. I was considering doing something a little more hands-on/creative with advertising and perhaps I still will, but I thought I'd give this a go for a while and see how she handles.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIf the thought of advertising strikes your fancy you should take a look. It works on a very fair and rational bidding system. Plus I think this site makes a good candidate for advertising since it gets a totally preposterous number of daily page views (like half a million or so), relative to number of visitors. That is an awful lot of fresh and discerning peepers ogling these pages. Perhaps they may ogle your enticing brands as well!\n"

A tale involving clever use of negative space.\n\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=2320\" target=\"_blank\">Bird Wizard (scroll down a couple posts)</a>: Another one of the firsts, about a bird wizard trapped in his office, PS-style. By the same guy who made those excellent PS youtube tributes.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nAnd a lot more!

And I didn't even know there would be \"acts\" until a few days ago! How about that!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThough aside from that, this is the point I've been pushing to get to in the story since I started. It took longer than I thought it would. I thought it might take about one month, but it turned out to be more like two. And by \"this point in the story\", I guess I mean \"the beginning\". Really everything that's happened so far probably serves as more of a prologue than a first chapter.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo we are just getting started! There is surely some fun stuff to come. \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nGlancing backwards, I can't help but monitor my progress. 55 days, 247 pages (with 295 images). That's a little more than 5 images per day, which is almost the exact pace I set with Problem Sleuth over the course of a year. I was very surprised to learn this! Mostly because many of these Homestuck pages are a lot more detailed and labor intensive, especially with the Flash animations mixed in there. I will decide this statistical analysis yields good news!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nIt also helps that I'm starting to get the hang of Flash. The most recent animation was much easier than any of its predecessors, and hardly felt like it took any time at all. I am THIS CLOSE to actually looking forward to doing the next one.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, also it will probably be a few days before I start updating again, just to give me a little time to gather some thoughts and prepare some things.

Instead of just slapping humorous or story-relevant stuff on a shirt (which is all well and fine, don't get me wrong!) I sort of wanted to take the opportunity to let this stuff tell a little story, and add some depth and detail to the Homestuck universe.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThere are two character shirts available (for preorder!), <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-ghost-white\" target=\"_blank\">John's</a> and <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/products/mspa-squiddle-white\" target=\"_blank\">Rose's</a>. But the shirts have their own little backstories, which are conveyed in corresponding prints, also <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/art\" target=\"_blank\">for sale</a>.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nI think the stories sort of speak for themselves through those graphics, but I'll go ahead and overexplain anyway. John's shirt, which of course appears to be Slimer from Ghostbusters, is actually a depiction of an Asian knock-off of Slimer called the <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/mspa-ghost-print.png\" target=\"_blank\">GREEN SLIME GHOST</a>. Rose's shirt was once a depiction of a character from a fake cute cartoon show which I totally made up called \"Squiddles!\". She then went about defacing this shirt to make it look mean! The shirt itself actually appears to be defaced, with ink missing around the eyes and mouth area (but it's a pretty subtle effect, because the ink color is very close to the shirt color).\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThe cool thing about <a href=\"/archive/social/blogspot/mspa-squiddle-print.png\" target=\"_blank\">Rose's print</a> is you can get either the faux-Lovecraftian defaced version, or the undefaced version (so you can deface it yourself!) Just make sure you select the option you want underneath: \"LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!\" if you want the defaced version, or \"DON'T LOVECRAFT MY SQUIDDLE!\" if you want it unmolested!\n\n<br/><br/>\n\nSo there you have it. The story of the shirts, and some sweet merch all rolled into one.\n"

To all you non-Americans, please refrain from feeling thankful for anything, or experiencing the emotion of gratefulness in any form. This weekend we've got that shit on lockdown.\n<br/><br/>\nI will now supply a number of things for you to click on and become absorbed in, ideally for hours.\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"/blogspot/interrogative-remarks-followed-by\" target=\"_blank\">I just did a little Q&amp;A session with some folks from the MSPA community.</a> It is all about Homestuck. You may find it illuminating.\n<br/><br/>\nAlso in this vein, a little while ago I posted some <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&amp;t=5189\" target=\"_blank\">HS concept sketches</a>. I will perhaps post more in the future.\n<br/><br/>\nAnd yet another topic I have been meaning to mention is the <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewforum.php?f=35\" target=\"_blank\">MSPA Fan Adventure Forum</a>, and some awards that community handed out recently to the most notable adventures. All the winners and categories can be found <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=5297\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>(Image loading logjam in there, sorta. Be warned.) \n<br/><br/>\nBut to cut to the chase, the one that took the Best <b>Active</b> Adventure trophy was <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=3476\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadly Dance of the Scarecrow King</a>. It's quite a fun read! I even did a bit of <a href=\"newspost_images/scarecrowking1.gif\" target=\"_blank\">fan art</a> <a href=\"newspost_images/scarecrowking2.gif\" target=\"_blank\">for it</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nAnd the votes for Best <b>Completed</b> Adventure went to a fine tale <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=38&amp;t=2997\" target=\"_blank\">Alanna</a>. This was apparently something of a landslide, and it took some other awards as well.\n<br/><br/>\nAnd the third among the top winners, Best <b>Inactive</b> Adventure went to <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=2967\" target=\"_blank\">Take my life in a completely different direction.</a> This is by none other than Michael Bowman, the virtuoso behind a number of Homestuck scores. Apparently this tale has since become <b>Non-Inactive</b>. Looks like you can mess with Bowman pretty good in there, and I cannot imagine why one would pass up such an opportunity.\n<br/><br/>\nAnd a final award getter worth noting, in that it won three separate awards including Best <b>Writing</b>, is <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=2967\" target=\"_blank\">1984 Quest</a>, a fever-pitched thriller packed with booze-fueled Orwellian crypto-mindrape. \n<br/><br/>\nAnd a personal honorable mention must go to <a href=\"http://www.mspaforums.com/viewtopic.php?f=35&amp;t=5233\" target=\"_blank\">Roomland</a>. There's some really sweet stuff going on in there. I'd like to find some more time to groom this forum for more of these personal 'HOTPIXX!!!' but dang that place is so busy it's hard to keep up with it all. I will conclude this is a good thing.\n<br/><br/>\nSo bottom line is, if you're having trouble figuring out what to do with yourself over the holidays, you can make no claim whatsoever not to have enough reading material. Get crackin'.\n"

I think this all makes a whole lot more sense. It might take some time for you to get used to it. In the interim you may feel a bit grumpy and mutter things about how it used to be so much better and how this basically sucks and is tantamount to me taking an exceptionally spirited and jovial dump into your grandmother's open casket. That is ok though, I respect that point of view. We will respectfully agree to agree that I am right and you are wrong.<br/><br/>So hey this thing's still on its wobbly baby deer legs so if you notice any bugs let me know! <br/><br/>Also guess what----new music albums up for sale real soon. Yes, albums plural. Volume 2 AND 3 at the same time. Guys this is a shitload of music we are talking about here, and these are NOT just carbon copies of all the Flash page songs you've already heard. This may even hit the <a href=\"/music\" target=\"_blank\">bandcamp store</a> later tonight. It is exciting. Stay tuned.<br/><br/>Also the downloads will be cheaper.<br/><br/>Which is a nice transition to this topic. SPEAKING OF CHEAP. I noticed recently that a graphic novel I did a few years ago is being offered at the SLG website for <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">free</span>. It is called <a href=\"/tso/whistles\" target=\"_blank\">Whistles</a>, and it can be yours for only what the mailman asks to bring it to you. This is kind of a good deal. I used to have a whole preview thing for this but I took it down since a web preview for a free book is sort of stupid. OWNING IT IS THE PREVIEW.  <a href=\"/scraps/whistlesprev.gif\" target=\"_blank\">But here's one of the pages if you're all curious-like.</a><br/><br/>And while we hover near the subject of bargains, I still have a number of <span style=\"color: rgb(51, 204, 255); font-weight: bold;\">blue</span> <a href=\"https://topatoco.com/collections/mspa/apparel\" target=\"_blank\">Sleuth Diplomacy shirts</a>, from way back before I sold through Topatoco. If you want 'em, you can have 'em at a discount. Just <a href=\"mailto:mcmittens@gmail.com\" target=\"_self\">email Cindy</a> and ask about sizes and shipping and stuff. If you act fast enough, she JUST MIGHT be able to get it to you before x-mas if that's your aim. I think the Topatoco holiday deadline has come and gone, so we will call this deal the PROCRASTINATOR'S SPECIAL.\n"

That is actually a bit longer than the <a href=\"/mspa/002657\" target=\"_blank\">end of act 2</a> (though a smaller file), but I don't remember the strain on the site being nearly as bad when I put that page up. I guess there are that many more people dialed into this thing than there were in October.<br/><br/>In spite of the length of the latest animation, it wasn't quite end of act material. Trust me, when I'm working on the real EOA, I will disappear HARD into the ominous cloak of radio silence, and it might make you a little nervous. This will probably be soon. I'm not leaving a lot of mystery surrounding this fact. At this point, any misdirection on what I was really up to would be a transparent ruse indeed.<br/><br/>When it is finished, the file will likely be so big, and get tapped by so many people at once, no one will be able to see it for weeks. I can see this all unfolding like a chessmaster recognizing the demise of his opponent (my server) 20 moves ahead. This is what we website administrators call THE PERFECT PLAN.\n"
